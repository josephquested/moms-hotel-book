MOM’S HOTEL












1. awake and falling

sometimes when i get high i swear i leave my body for real. not in some poetic way or anything like that, i honest to god feel myself leaving. or more like, i wake up once i’ve already left it a while ago. it’ll be that i’m way up above the hotel in the sky, way up above the roof so as i can see it down below and even the clouds look small and blurry. see it like a bird or like the moon would see it. the neon sign lights up all the fog until it’s thick pink foam and i can feel the outside air on my skin and in my nose. it’s so different to breathe than inside air that it’s hard to describe, like all my normal air has been dead for years and i’m just breathing on the corpse in and out. there is some places on the lower levels where people have bashed little cracks in the windows and i’ve tried to breathe from them before but you can tell it’s not outside air. if it was i would be able to tell straight away because i know what it feels like to breathe it when i’m awake and falling way up in the sky. 
after i’ve had my fill with looking i start to fall down at a speed which is somewhat under my control. the hotel is a little glowing black square way below until all of a sudden i’m slipping into the pink foam and it’s right in front of me. the glow of the neon sign stings my eyes which i think is no big deal, they probably didn’t figure on people getting so close to it on account of it being so high up. i always have a game where i try to compare my body to the letters of the sign as i’m falling past them to determine how big they are. i reckon standing straight with my arms stretched fully upright i might be half the height of the O in “MOM”, or any of the letters for that matter. the font is the same as it is inside on all the signs for the bathrooms, so when i’m going and i’m looking at the sign sometimes i like to imagine myself standing inside the little O. sometimes when i’m high and going in the bathroom i swear i can almost see myself laying down around in the curve of the O like i’m asleep, but that’s just a fun trick of the mind and not at all like when i’m awake and falling outside.
once i make it below the sign it starts to get easier to see on account of my eyes not stinging so bad from the light. all the floors are laid out just like they are on the map because it’s real, and i can see people going about their stuff through the windows. first i fall past the penthouse and Mom is always there in the same spot in bed, i always try to make eye contact but she’s always looking away or i’m going too fast to get a good fix on her eyes. i’ve nearly asked her a bunch of times if she’s seen me falling past her window before but i figured that when she does she’ll bring it up and i don’t want to bring it up first incase i seem crazy. i know she’ll seem really relieved when she sees me again after seeing me fall past the window, because it would come as a huge surprise and probably she’d be worrying that i was dead. or she’d be thinking that she was crazy! i know i’d be thinking one or the other if i saw someone falling past my window at night, that’s for sure. 
anyway once i’m done falling there i keep going and i can see rich people living in the nice rooms, and for the most part it looks like they’re having fun. normally i try to fall slower around these floors because they’re the most interesting. sometimes i can see them arguing or looking lonely, but mostly they’re eating or watching stuff on the intranet and sometimes they’re even having sex. it’s a rare sight but it’s premium because everyone on the rich floors is fat almost without exception, so seeing them have sex is a curio. there are only a couple hundred videos of people having sex on the intranet, and they’re all skinny people. that’s why seeing a glimpse of them like this is premium like i mentioned. i figure that making a sex video for the intranet is a way of making money outside if you’re caught short for cash, so it makes sense that rich people don’t do it. i’ve wondered before if the rich people feel left out when they’re watching those videos on the intranet because nobody looks even a little bit like them. floors 430-435 is the casino and these are also really interesting floors to fall past. you see a lot of people drinking and smoking and occasionally poking pens. normally when i poke pens they’re loaded with something to wind me down like Mdaz, or when i want to fall outside i do half Psilo half K which they call a “PK pen”. in the casino though i figure they’re all probably loading Speed orelse something that keeps them gambling and sharp all night. poking an Mdaz pen up there would set you far too optimistic on each hand of cards and you’d end up betting all your chips on a single pair or even on nothing at all. for as much as you can tell by falling past them, it appears like the people in the casino blink hardly ever at all if you catch my meaning. they always seem to be handing over their big pile of tokens but never looking too sad about it, they just laugh and someone comes to restock their tokens again in no time at all. 

just below 430 there are some maid floors which is where my fascination starts to wane sometimes, but they’re still interesting. mostly it’s just old servants and old bots washing dishes or folding linen. rich people don’t much trust young maids or newer bots because they get “ill notions”. they only ever entertain the company of youth if the purpose of that company is that they want something young, if you catch my meaning. every fifteen levels or so there’s a little block of maid floors and they tend to get younger and younger as you go down. some drunk bastard told me once that in the bottom hundred there’s near on babies cleaning down there, but i’m pretty sure he was just blowing hot air. from what i understand it there isn’t much of any cleaning going on down there at all, babies or otherwise. sometimes when you’re falling past these nice maid floors you’ll see a chef in there preparing up something really premium like a goat. the goats are raised somewhere way lower down and they take a long time to mature, that’s why i say they’re rare and you’d only see them being prepared above 400 for a rich person who is accustomed to something really premium. as you get further down the animal meals get fewer and far between, below i’d say 300 they’re gone altogether and people are just eating vegetables if you’re lucky or pastes if you’re not. around my number there might still be one or two rooms prioritising animal meals, i’ve never had a taste for them myself and that’s fine by me. you meet people who act like eating their animal meal is bringing them some sort of rush and for me that is unbecoming. for me, the meals are just what they are. once you know a real rush from something like poking pens i don’t know how you could go on pretending like you’re getting a rush from an animal meal.
falling through the high 300s it’s pretty much all OK rooms and you start to get near my floor. the people you see through the windows down here are mostly on the intranet orelse they’re high or out working. Mom has kept going at me for ages about moving up to the 400s so as i can be closer in eyeshot but i can’t stand the thought. damn near every rich person you meet is onto you about some hot new currency they’re peddling, either for you or just as a means of making “a connection” to someone else you might know. needless to say you can double and triple that five times over for me because of who i am and because they know i can get in with Mom, basically whenever i want to more or less. i swear to god, i would sooner move down 200. at least down there when people beg you they’re forthright about it and you know it’s because they’re hungry or want to get high or whatever else. i would take that any day over some fat man offering me “exciting opportunities”, that’s for sure. and what’s more, down there often people might not even recognise me. there’s a bar i like on 240 which doesn’t even have a name because it’s more or less just a room where people get drunk. i could sit in there having a drink all day and nobody would bother me in the slightest. you better believe i would sooner move there in a heartbeat than go anywhere near the nice rooms. sad news is when i’m falling i don’t get to get my eyes on any of the lower floors. my stop always comes at the same place where i started. there’s some places like the factories and the farms down in the 200s that must be something else to fall past, i’ve been there just wandering around of course but it must be something else to see them falling. not even to mention the places i’ve never stepped foot in down in the 100s where things start to get real rough and you wouldn’t want to get caught nosing around. people tell stories about getting down below the lower clouds and seeing the honest to god earth, but you always have to give them the side eye upon hearing stories like that. more often than not it’s some grown up boy blowing hard who’s never actually stepped foot in the 100s let alone the double digit floors. you’ll hear much more theorizing than first hand accounts anyway, that’s for sure. the last security office is on 99 and anything that goes on below that is between god and who ever else is involved. anyways i always get melancholy and start to fall as slow as i can once i start getting near my floor. my room is on 338 and i always know i’m getting close because of a certain pattern of windows that i can’t easily describe and my hand always starts getting itchy. as soon as i can see my window i can see myself laying there. i never get as much time as i want to ponder how i look. it’s not an opportunity you get often to really see yourself as if you were just some other person. when you look eye to eye in the mirror it feels very much like you’re looking at yourself, but when i’m awake and falling i can really see myself like a stranger. fully candid. i would just pause myself in the air there if i could and look for probably an hour without getting bored, no kidding. i can only ever linger like that for a second or two though, and then i can feel my eyes opening up even though they were already open. i look out the window straight away to try and catch a glimpse of myself falling but i’m always just a second too late. 

2. feeling time

once i got my bearings again i realised my blankets had gotten all wrapped around my line like they have a habit of doing and it was wicked itchy. most people these days have a small IV line in on the back of the hand to make it easier for poking a pen, or it’s supposed to make it easier anyway. i find they’re more trouble than they’re worth sometimes because they’re always getting itchy or flirting with infection. my skin was bone cold too, probably because my room was pretty cold like i normally keep it but actually probably because of how long i was falling out there. i took a real slow breath out to try savor the feeling of the outside air in my lungs but it was already all dead and recirculated. upon taking further stock of my state i was all kinds of shivering and pretty sickened too, in need of some kindnesses for sure. my bedside clock blinked 12:00 like it always does and i used the periodic flashes of red light to fumble around for antinausea capsules on the side table. most people prefer yellow Ondan tablets because they’re less likely to give you diarrhea than the purple ones, but they work a little bit worse. i normally take the purple ones because i like how effective they are and i’m generally not opposed to a little diarrhea, i think it gets a unfair rap unless you have something you really need to do that day. my room came into focus as my eyes adjusted back to the inside light and i’d be lying if i said it was in a perfect state. i told the maids to stop coming in a long time ago because they kept throwing away stuff that i figured still had some good use in. i like to smoke all my cigarettes twice, i smoke them all once to the place where you’d usually stop, set them down, then come back again a day or two later and then go again until it gets dicey on account of burning your fingers. i figure that this way i have basically twice as many, or some percentage more anyway. 
i tried to explain this to the maids and even showed a demonstration of which ones are ready for second smoking, but they couldn’t get the measure of it. in the end it was easier to just leave them be and tidy up on my own, because i didn’t want to be giving the same demonstration of second smoking over and over. i feel for the maids and i know they work a lot to make the same amount of money i make by doing nothing, so it didn’t feel right to be lecturing them or getting cross when they misjudged the measure of which cigarettes were still good for second smoking. crucial above all else in that moment though was loading a pen with Mdaz to find either sleep, orelse just some respite from the shivers that were plaguing me. some portion of it was surely just my chilled skin, but i also had a lingering anxiety about me. sometimes after a PK pen the Psilo part overstays its welcome and has a nasty paranoiac edge to it. without the K to balance things out you’ll find yourself double checking shadows in the room to make sure they’re still as they should be, or fixating on certain noises that may or may not be happening. it was raining outside so i found myself getting concerned and even downright upset at the way the drops were rolling down the window. some of them were converging too effectively, such that they became significantly larger than the other ones and it felt alienating to the smaller drops. 
these kinds of nervous personifications are good evidence that something has gone out of balance in your dose. when you’ve got your dose dialed in just right you won’t find yourself lost in sad empathy for the raindrops, they’ll all be doing just fine how they are or even be a source of relaxation. 
anyway all that to say i was getting increasingly restless to find a full Mdaz pottle and it seemed determined on not being found. Mdaz more than any drug i know has a nasty tendency to not be possessed in the quantities that you remember. god damn near as soon as you’ve poked the pen you forget that you’ve done it, and your mental inventory is immediately suspect. the pottles play into this little sham too because they’re fairly heavy on their own and the liquid is transparent. so as you’ll be thinking you have one or two left for sure in your mental inventory, and then upon picking them up the ruse is still alive until you see that the top has already been punctured by the pen. that’s one thing i do miss about having the maids around checking in on me, they’re always quick to remove the old pottles and it’s harder for you to get your hopes up on an empty one. needless to say i inspected them all anyway and concluded that a trip out would have to happen immediately. i was in a bit of a sorry state and usually i like to compose myself a little more when leaving the room, but i wanted to feel better quite urgently. 
all the clocks in the hotel run on centralised time, which means that when Mr Fab went quiet they all stopped working. i can vaguely remember what it was like back when they still worked, back when i was really young. i have little mini recollections of laying in bed and watching the numbers go up and up then back to the start again on my bedside clock. there are still a few big clocks in the hotel that work by some kind of mechanical system so they’re not on centralised time, there’s one in Mom’s penthouse and another one down on the farm floors that i know about. some people also have portable versions of these mechanical clocks but evidently they’re really tricky to make so owning one is extremely premium. i could have one i’m sure if i asked for it, but so few people keep time that it’s not a very useful measurement. and what’s more, most people you’d meet down here think of it as unbecoming to reference the time because it portrays a certain vanity or status. people already act wrong to me and treat me like i belong on the 400s as it is, so i definitely won’t be caught dead with a mechanical clock, that’s for sure. 
though i must admit, i would be lying if i said that “feeling” the time, as they call it, is a great system. unkept time is a wickedly subjective thing, you might have plans to meet up with so-and-so after so much felt time, and yet feel the time totally different to them. layer on top of that most people are poking pens or smoking tars or whatever else, which of course magnifies the personal nature of time feeling. people tend to be kind on this fact though, especially young people who have grown up without keeping time. for most of the year it’s dark outside for pretty much the whole day, on account of the hotel being very far away from the middle part of the earth and the earth being tilted. this means that mostly you feel time based on how long it feels since it was bright out, but it’s easy to miss! you could easily (and i do, often) doze off during the hour or two that it’s bright out and awake still thinking you’re in the same day. i’ve gone probably four days before still thinking it was the same one because i happened to doze off at coincidentally bad times. 
all this to say, the time then felt to me like it had been many hours since the sunlight. this meant that the preferable stores for buying Mdaz pottles were most likely closed, likely enough that it wasn’t worth the trouble to go check them and face disappointment. it’s important to keep a roster of backup plans for situations like this, and keep it mentally maintained so you know which plan is least likely to lead to heartbreak. about 10 floors down from me is a pen room run by a man named Nik, i don’t like him but is pretty much always having a party, or at least there. i figured i could get myself together enough to make it down and back and keep my cool. the raindrops on the window had begun to move faster and now i was getting concerned about the slow ones. i second smoked a few cigarettes and watched them anxiously as i built the nerve to stand up, some were moving alarmingly slowly but thankfully none were completely still. eventually i slid back into my underpants and put on a loose jumpsuit, it had a zip that started at my crotch and went all the way up to my chin. it also had a hood and one big kangaroo pocket for my pen, key, cigarettes and my money pouch. i stopped to take a look at myself in the mirror across the room before i zipped it up, my skin looked really pale and almost silver. the moonlight was strong from behind the clouds and i could see shadows of the raindrops running down my whole body. it looked like an endless parade of black ants were escaping out my head and running for their lives.  

3. echoing howl 

the hallway was piercingly bright. in truth it was probably just fine, but i keep the lights off in my room pretty much at all times. i only turn them on temporarily if i’m really certain that a sneaky pottle has evaded me and is hiding somewhere in the darkness. there’s no hiding out in the hallway though, that’s for sure. just long stretches of cream plaster walls and humming incandescent lights hanging from the ceiling above every set of doors. the amount of rooms per floor is different depending on how far up you are, but on my floor there are 108 rooms. my room is numbered 338.102, which is one of the better ones to have. you either want to be near the end of a floor or near the start because that’s where the stairwells are. elevators are dotted along the hallway so i guess it used to be better to live near them, but they all run on the centralised system so they don’t work anymore. the doors still open and close but none of the buttons do anything. it’s neat all the things people have found to use them for though, like around my level people will set up shops in the elevators for selling cigarettes or drinks, and further down people live in them like they’re tiny little rooms. it’s pitch black inside once you close the doors, so kids use them for kissing and teenagers use them for sex. up on the nice floors rich people don’t have much kind of imagination or trust for anything, so the maids use them for storage. if you ask me, it’s pretty neat all the things people find to do with a little room when you give them one. i quickly slipped into the stairway and started my journey down, and let me tell you the stairways are a mammoth thing indeed. there are some smaller ones for maid access hidden around the place, but they aren’t much worth talking about. the main stairways live on either end of the hotel like it’s a body with two spines, and they are almost unbelievably large to comprehend. wide enough that you could have a party of ten people walking beside each other arm-in-arm no problem, and what feels like infinitely tall. not really of course, but pretty much. if you put your neck out into the void over the railing, you can look up and look down and never come to see the top or the bottom. they must be miles high for real but i don’t know the exact measure of it. the steps are all dressed in old carpet for the most part but with hard stone edges, wicked hard if you stumble and catch your shin on the lip which i do on a damn near daily basis. i swear my shins haven’t gone unbruised a day in my life living up and down these stairs. the most godless thing about them is the sound. i suppose the architects must have done their best in thinking about this, but they didn’t do their best enough. when people are walking and talking one or two floors above or below you, you can pretty much hear them clear as day. then countless more people are walking and talking, about god knows what or how many floors away, and all their sounds start to bounce around inside each other and start procreating. you’ll be hearing hundreds or maybe thousands of little whispers and laughs and screams and cries, all overlapping. an echoing howl born all the way at the bottom, flung up the void, then ricocheting off the top and howling back down again. like you got every TV set in the world and somehow crammed them snuggly into your own head and turned them all on at once. 

i tell you it’s enough to make you think you’re going crazy if you come in here after the wrong pen, or otherwise just fragile for whatever reason. i wasn’t feeling in the best state for it, but i had felt a lot worse. luckily i had two things working for me, first of which based on some intangible quality of the echoing howl i could tell the hotel was sleepy. this confirmed my earlier theory that it was probably close to the next sunlight hour, which means a lot of people would be asleep or otherwise too tired for laughing and screaming. the second thing was i only had about 10 floors to descend before arriving at Nik’s corridor, so the journey would be mercifully short even at my impaired speed. ideally i would make it down the stairs without tripping or getting drawn into any kind of unwanted interactions. people don’t tend to go down the corridors unless they’re going to their room orelse have some kind of business there, so most of every social interaction you’ll have is on the stairs. i don’t have a huge amount of what you would call friends necessarily, although i am friendly with a lot of people and damn near every person knows who i am at least. basically every time i make eye contact with someone there will be a little flash of something come across their face, like a little moment of shock and surprise or sometimes excitement. i figure it’s not actually even about me really, more like they just see me and then immediately think of Mom and that gets them feeling some kind of way. the really wrong thing is sometimes i do it too, i’ll catch a reflection of myself and think of her instead of thinking about me. that kind of stuff doesn’t make much sense and isn’t worth dwelling on. 

i made it down to the landing at floor 327 which is Nik’s floor. there were a few people milling around the hallway entrance there like there normally is and i didn’t much feel like getting involved with them. an older man was slumped up against the wall with his eyes slightly flicking open and closed but he looked like he was having a good time. i could see a pen loosely gripped in his left hand and a half empty pottle of expensive Fent balancing on his thigh. the expensive stuff comes in a really premium plastic pottle with embossed pale green metal ridges on the sides, and i’m not lying when i say it feels really premium. when you run your thumbnail down the metal ridges they make tiny melodic tinking sounds that are not quite a song but damn near close. interacting with one of those pottles is pretty much a joy all own its own before you even get to the Fent, and certainly a joy afterwards. they’re something to be wary of though, especially if you’re more accustomed to the watery variety or a similar-but-cheap drug from the lower floors. one quarter of one of these “ribcage” pottles as they call them is probably stronger than a whole pen of the normal stuff. i don’t go in for the ribcages personally, or much of that kind of rush at all myself. not just because of the price (they are wicked expensive) but also because of the routine of it all. you see a person get in on the ribcages and all of the sudden it’s all they want to chat about and schedule around. it’ll take a stand up person and turn them sick, or just as soon it’ll take a sick person and turn them dead as the inside air.
standing right in front of the hallway door there were a couple of younger girls and a flashy looking bot, they were all prattling on in fast paced conversation. it’s considered rude to hang out right in front of the door, but i’m not the kind of person who makes a big deal out of stuff like that. the bot was going on about his arms and how strong they are. he made a joke about having completely smooth metal fingers and the girls laughed in a flirty way. i wanted to quickly glance at the fingers to see how smooth they were, but i had to turn sideways and make myself skinny to fit past the girls without bumping into them. there was a split second where my face was really close to the girl’s face and we were accidentally looking straight into each other's eyes at point blank range. this was exactly the kind of intimate interaction i wanted to avoid, and is exactly why it’s rude to stand right in front of the hallway door. i could see her eyes make almost instantaneous transitions from nothing, to confused, to shock, and finally shy or maybe excited, and then i was through the door and it slammed shut behind me. 
if i was in a different way like not still feeling edgy from the Psilo, i might have stopped and talked a while to them. in truth though, it’s a silly thought. when i imagine it i picture myself in their situation having the conversation like they were having it. i imagine myself like the girls, laughing flirty at the bot and him showing off for me. or maybe i’m the bot and i’m showing off for the girls, bragging about my smooth parts and who knows what else. in reality, i would be me and they would be them and i’d immediately be in the spotlight. the bot wouldn’t be talking about his fingers and the girls wouldn’t be flirty laughing. they’d all just be talking about Mom, most likely, or wanting to talk about her at least. we might pretend like we’re happily talking to each other about this and that, but really we’d all just be standing there. awkwardly not talking about her.

4. i know you

Nik lived a fair way down the hall and it felt like an accomplishment just to make it out of the stairway, so i took a moment to reward myself. i pressed my back into the wall and gently slid down until my ass hit the floor, the carpet was very thin and i could feel the cold concrete underneath transferring a chill up into my thighs. after fishing around in my kangaroo pocket for a moment i found my cigarettes and realised i had forgotten a lighter. this isn’t that big of a deal because damn near everyone carries a lighter, everyone except airheads like me apparently. mind you i wasn’t stoked about the sensation of asking someone for one, if god is merciful it can just be a quick transaction without too many pleasantries. i sat slumped against the wall for a while, probably 45 of the longest seconds of my life until a girl came out of the staircase door. she was young like me, young and pretty but she looked tired. she had short brown hair and seemed kind of familiar. she didn’t seem like she was going to look down at me on her own so i announced myself quietly, “uh, hello.” she glanced down but kept moving at first, “hey- oh, hi!” she said. during that tiny response i saw the usual three act play of recognition quickly flash over her face. thankfully she settled on a warm expression that was comforting, and didn’t trigger my Psilo cursed brain to sound any alarm bells. 

“what are you doing here?” she said. i could tell she was still kind of shocked to see me, i didn’t know whether it would be rude to stay slumped against the wall or if i should stand up. “i’m here to visit with someone but i was wondering if you have a lighter, ” my words were more run together than i had hoped they would be. not totally slurring or anything, but i definitely would have preferred about twice as much space between all of them. “yeah, yeah of course,” she said, feeling around in a deep pocket on the side of her skirt. she pulled out a cheap lime green flick lighter and handed it down to me. i plucked it out of her hand carefully so as to not accidentally touch her fingers and mumbled, “thanks, i’m always forgetting mine one place or another. i just need to keep it in the damn cigarette box, or keep an extra one so i have one to lose.” she smiled. she didn’t seem to notice that my words were coming out a little lumpy, or if she did notice she didn’t seem worried about it. i had a tiny amount of trouble getting my cigarette going (nothing major) and then handed the lighter back to her. she asked if she could join me for one and i said yes. in truth, i would have probably preferred the cigarette alone. i’m not the kind of person that would ever say something like that to someone though, i hold a bit of a double standard when it comes to that kind of stuff. i wouldn’t begrudge someone saying something like that to me, or i might even find it endearing, but me being so upfront like that to someone was totally out of the question. “it’s Antina by the way,“ the girl said, sliding down the wall next to me and lighting her cigarette. “thanks, i mean. cool, it’s a premium name,” i felt like i was fumbling the interaction even more now that she was on my level, and the cigarette was making my throat wicked dry. “thanks,” she said, “it’s OK. people call me Anti, which i think makes me sound like i’m an ant. or they’ll pronounce it like antenna, which really pisses me off too.” i nodded, i never know whether to introduce myself to new people by telling them my name, because more often than not i say my name and they say “i know”, and then a silence follows that makes everyone want to die. i think it’s kind of rude for me not to say it though. “i’m Sen,” i blurted it out quickly, taking another sip of my cigarette and kind of looking away. “yeah i know,” she said. i must have made some kind of face when she said that because she quickly followed up, “i mean, i know you. we’ve met before, a couple of times. at Nik’s place. is that why you’re on this level?” “oh shit,” i said, “shit sorry yeah, i thought you looked familiar, sorry there are always so many people there, and the lighting...” i lost my train of thought, “yeah i came down to see if Nik is in, i thought i had one more Mdaz but you know how they are, you always think you have one or two more than you actually do.” she laughed, “yeah i do that too. i always forget to throw away the packet,” i coughed and tried to make it sound like an agreement sound, “yes-,” i coughed again. my throat felt like it had never once come into contact with any form of liquid. 
“hang on, can you hold my cigarette?” she started rummaging around in her skirt pocket and her eyes went unfocused, like they were just staring straight through the wall. i could tell she was using her mind's eye to mentally assess the shape of many different items. the pocket was confusingly deep, it could accommodate her arm all the way up the elbow as she hunted around in there. she pulled out an empty pottle of Mdaz and her expression twisted in frustration. after a couple more failed attempts she finally produced a full pottle, “i think i actually only had one empty packet in there, i was just putting it back and finding it again,” she laughed, “i spend most of my life laying traps for myself to fall into later.” she set the pottle down on the ground between us and took back her cigarette. “i can’t take that pottle if it’s your last one,” i said. “oh yeah, i definitely don’t want to give it to you,” she laughed again, a warm kind of laugh, i could tell i was welcome to laugh too if i wanted. “we can share it though, i’m really tired anyway so i’d probably fall asleep right here on the floor if i had the whole thing myself.” i said thank you a bunch as we began about getting our pens ready, and i was already feeling a little bit better than before. Antina had a kind way about her, so i wasn’t overthinking everything quite as much as i usually do in this type of situation. “do you want to just do it here, or would you like to go somewhere else?” she said, “do you know the 322 gardens?” i shook my head no, i didn’t know them, “my body is wicked angry with me right now, i don’t think i want to brave the stairs again yet,” she agreed and didn’t want the stairs right now either. Mdaz pottles have little white lines on the side dividing them into quarters, so it’s easy to share them or have them in measured doses yourself. only problem being that once you have punctured the foil top, you can’t reseal them again. this means that if you do try have them in portions, you’re more likely than not to just bump them over and lose the remainder. i have had this happen to me probably 100 times, and then undergone the undignified act of trying to fill the pen from a puddle of essentially invisible liquid on the ground. it is kind of impossible if you spill it onto carpet, but i have still tried of course. one time i basically got the lot of it up, but i could see a bunch of carpet fibers and little mysterious dots floating around inside the pen. i sat there for probably a whole night just staring at it, trying to decide whether injecting carpet fibers would kill you. ultimately i decided they might, because i imagined them latching themselves onto the little textures in your heart or something like velcro, so i threw it away. Antina went first and then passed the half pottle over to me. her pen was dark purple with a cute sticker of a bat on it. i could see her muscles all melt into the wall and she breathed out slowly, a long even breath. “thanks,” i said again and filled my pen with the rest of the clear liquid. i pushed the tip right down into the corners of the pottle to make sure i got it all. i’ve thought before that there must be a better shape to make them, so as you don’t have to be so deliberate about getting all the corners. in fact, i would say all the rigmarole of using a pen makes it basically the worst way of consuming drugs. you have to be worrying about getting all the liquid or worrying if you’re having too much, not to mention the hassle of having a line. always catching it on your sleeves as you put on clothes, always getting itchy. 
if pens weren’t such a fantastically effective way of delivering the rush, they would be bottom of the barrel when it comes to enjoyableness. personally i much prefer the simplicity of swallowing a pill, not to mention the portability due to their compact size which is excellent. however, they take ages to come into effect and require patience. you can speed things up by having them as a powder up the nose, but that requires much more preparation and additional equipment so it bumps them down a grade. smoking is undeniably the most visually appealing method, but only when cigarettes are involved. it’s funny how quickly you go from looking sexy while smoking a cigarette to absolutely feral smoking a pipe. i think it’s about the shape of your hand holding the lighter and the unnatural position of your arm. elbow cocked at a sharp angle and flat, parallel to the body, objectively unappealing. the most boring-yet-functional method has to be transdermal patches. nobody knows when you have one on, and you yourself forget immediately too. going about the entire day and not even noticing that you have been ambiently useless since morning. i would rank them low, due to their passive nature and again, the tendency to get itchy. all that being said, i poked the pen into my line and immediately felt Mdaz rocket through my blood. it crashed against all the little textures inside my heart, flew up my spine and enveloped my brain in a warm slosh. all my petty criticisms vanished, and my entire soul was as light as a plastic tube. 

5. roses

we both just lay there for a good while before saying anything. i had slid even further down onto the ground, the hard concrete below the carpet was still emanating its chill and i emanated warmth back affectionately. Antina lit another cigarette and rolled her head to look at me. “do you know how old you are?” i said no, only roughly, “do you?”  “no, i thought you might. like somebody would be keeping track for you or something.” i fished another cigarette out of my kangaroo pocket and turned to to face her. she passed me the lighter. “i don’t know,” i said, “if someone is, they haven’t told me about it.” people can make mechanical clocks like i mentioned, but there is no such thing as a mechanical calendar that i know about. to combat this, some of the older people have been doing their best to count each day as it comes down on paper. i’ve only heard references to this practice, but as far as i can tell it’s basically nonsense. people seem to have just as much trouble feeling the years as they do feeling the hours, and i wouldn’t trust any old person on their word claiming to give you an exact date. i’ve heard five years, twenty, and everything in between. Antina took a long sip of her cigarette, “i think we look the same age,” she said. smoke bounced out of her mouth with each syllable, slowly curling up towards the incandescent bulb on the ceiling. “do you remember when Mr Fab was still working?” the bulb hummed and illuminated her smoke, i thought about the pink foam. “yeah, just barely. i remember my bedside clock working, and i remember talking to Mr Fab on the TV set,” i said. “i remember his voice sounding funny. i remember a maid telling me he sounded like that because he had an english accent. she said she lived in england before coming here and her old boss sounded just like Mr Fab.” i coughed and took another sip of my cigarette. “were you born here?” “yeah of course,” she said, “i can remember his voice too. i always thought that must be what god sounded like. i mean, i know that’s ironic now,” her eyes were fixed on some invisible point in the ceiling. “it must be comforting being a bot and knowing that there is a god, or was, or whatever. i don’t believe in god obviously, but if i could remember talking to him i probably would.” she laughed dismissively like she knew she was just high, rambling. “i think it sounds horrible,” i said, “knowing him, then he leaves and you don’t know why. especially for the older bots, the centralised ones. i think they.. were him? or some part of them was him anyway. i can’t even imagine what that would feel like, if a part of you suddenly vanished and every moment of your life you were just waiting for it to come back.” we talked about this for a quite a while. i said it sounds like phantom limb syndrome, she said it sounds like god went out for a pack of cigarettes and never came back. “i just don’t think i could live like that, waiting all the time,” she lit another cigarette off the glowing butt of her last one, “and you see that with the younger ones. my floor is low down, so most of my friends are bots. the only time they bring up Mr Fab is when they’re talking shit about centralised bots that worship him,” she had rolled onto her stomach and was laying straight across the floor like a torpedo, “they’re all too busy working or getting high or trying to fuck, just like the rest of us, they don’t have time for god.” we lay there in silence for a while and i thought about what it would be like to be a bot. i thought about Antina and her friends and what they do together. i pictured her hanging out with them and imagined some of their conversations. i tried to imagine her telling them about me, and wondered if they would be interested or not care. bots tend to not care about Mom as much as people do, so they’re more likely to not care about me. “how far down is your room?” i asked. “282.” that was low, for a person anyway. “what do you do down there?” i tried my best to sound casual, and not like i was being any kind of way about where she lived. “i work at the farms on 260. not food farming. i grow flowers for the 400s,” she took a sip of her cigarette and looked over at me, “i’ve never been up that far, so i don’t really know what they do with them. i picture like, some rich fat guy giving his girl one of my roses, or sprinkling the petals on the bed or something romantic. they always seem to need more and more roses, so maybe they’re eating them, i don’t know.” i rolled over, “they’re for the casino,” i said, “on 433 or 434, i can’t remember, there’s a restaurant in the casino called By Any Other Name. the entire bar is covered in roses, hundreds. it smells crazy in there, it’s kind of overwhelming.” she had a confusing expression on her face, like excited grief. “oh.” she thought about it for a while, “well, that’s fucking typical, isn’t it? rich people never fail to take something that is magical in moderation, then demand so much of it that it becomes sickening.” she angrily flicked her cigarette butt against the wall and it exploded in a tiny little shower of sparks. “so basically one third of my entire existence is dedicated to making some bullshit marketing gimmick possible, and people don’t even like it.” she laughed and kicked her feet against the wall and then kicked me. “should we go to that asshole’s room and buy this stuff already? i’m getting cold laying on the floor.” i said yes and we both inched our way back up to a standing position. my thirst was truly getting out of hand. “you don’t have any water in that bottomless pocket do you? i feel like i am in the early to middle stages of death,” she rummaged around with an exaggerated panic look on her face, just as a joke, “no, i feel like that too though. we’ll have to hold out until Nik’s place, or if things get really urgent we might need to drink each other’s piss.” we slowly shambled forwards down the hallway. i said that in a survival type situation, people normally drink their own piss. she scoffed dismissively, “Sen, that’s disgusting.”

6. woke up dead / birds on a wire

the hotel is a surprisingly nondescript building from the outside. surprising because, when it opened, it was sold to the world as the most premium place that there is on earth. 
‘L'avenir Est Comme Ca’: The Future Is Like This. that’s the subtitle, it’s in french for no reason. everybody knows the story of the hotel, because the story is everywhere. pretty much damn near every wall you look at has a picture of the hotel, a picture of Mom (or both), and plaques. plaques on every surface ramble on about every possible detail: how it was designed, how it was built, how it’s run, Mr Fab, the bots, the intranet, the currency, the maids, the farms, the ‘Bottled Ecosystem’. no matter where you are, you are within eyeshot is a wall of text explaining to you how lucky you are to be there, and you feel lucky. i haven’t ever met one single person, outsider or local, that wants to leave. even now, when damn near most of the place doesn’t work anymore, everyone you ask would say that this is the closest thing earth has to paradise. once i met a wobbly old man in a 200s bar who moved in the day they opened the doors. he said to me, “the shine has come off the apple a little over the years, but that doesn’t matter one bit when the juice tastes this sweeeet.” this old bastard was splayed out on the floor, ambiguously bleeding from some hidden wound, begging for tokens. my life has never been in a rough shape like that, but even if it was i know i would feel the same way. people speculate that the outside doors don’t even open anymore, (they were most likely on the centralised system) but nobody has cared to check that i know of. people might wish their lives to be better, but by better they just mean maybe a little further up. maybe a few more tokens, or a little less work. a few more pottles than they have right now, and a new sweetheart to share them with. something in the old, dead air just tastes like home on your tongue. there are thousands of videos on the intranet of places all over the world, we’re not dumb about what’s going on out there. it looks like a beautiful place! i figure i’d probably live in a big city like New York or Dubai if i wasn’t born here, because they’ve got some pretty tall buildings. i only trust a building so long as it’s above the clouds. i reach my arms up and they stretch so far, tall like the tall buildings in New York. my sleeves are like the clouds. a little drip falls from the mouth of my line into my open windows. it’s so sour and peppery. hot but not temperate with little lumps. my vision comes into focus, my arms and then the ceiling, it’s red and dark and loud. the lights are screaming. 
“you back with us kid?” my eyes started bouncing around the walls and fixing on the faces around me, they were empty and sneering. “what?” i said, my voice was tiny. everyone laughed. “little Baby can’t handle the pen.” i sat up and all the blood rushed to my head. a small circle of people were humming around me, loud whispering to each other over the music. colored light strips ran across the ceiling behind a thick layer of smoke, they bathed everyone in an ominous red haze. their teeth were glowing yellow. i tried to say something but my lips barely moved. everyone laughed. “come again kid?” i worried i might vomit and not be able to open my mouth, where would it go. “what’d i have?” i asked the audience. they laughed again, more subdued, like i told the same joke twice in a row. “wishbone. looks like yours came true.” someone passed me an empty container. it was a Speed pottle, but it was stained a milky color and i could see little brown flecks all over the plastic on the inside. a mod drug. my heart was pounding and my skin felt numb, there was clearly some kind of amphetamine VS hallucinogen race war waging in my bloodstream. my eyes bounced around the room in really fast slow motion. “where’s Antina?” i said, but nobody heard me. the audience had lost interest. a girl was laying near me, trying to fill her pen from another modded pottle and everyone had started focusing on her. she was having trouble getting through the foil top, it looked like her hands weren’t working properly. shaking and then balling up, she was digging her nails into her palms but smiling widely. her breasts were exposed and someone was trying to paw at them from slightly too far away. she was twisting her torso either towards them to make it easier, or possibly away to make it harder, i couldn’t tell. that was a good encapsulation of the entire tone in general; i couldn’t tell whether this was a really fun party, or if i had just woke up dead in hell. it certainly looked like hell, visually speaking anyway. glowing red, thick with smoke, little flames erupting at random from around the landscape, an ambient sense of danger, countless demons.. but all the demons looked like they were having so much fun. they were all laughing and cuddling, i couldn’t see anyone having sex but it definitely felt like they were, somewhere very nearby. maybe i was having fun too? it was truly impossible to tell. a red hand swooped in from stage left and lit the cigarette that was evidently already in my mouth. “thank you!” i shouted, “this cigarette is premium!” waves of joyful terror swept through my body. the girl had managed to get a pottle open and poked the pen into her line. demons were on either side of her, pinching at her nipples. “hey she got it open- you got it open!” i yelled at her twitching body. my teeth were chattering because i was enjoying my cigarette so much. i was nibbling on the filter like a little piece of spongy bubblegum. a demonic bot was tapping me on the shoulder from behind, “hey! are you the Baby?” i turned around and looked at him. his eyes were glowing. “yeah!” i shouted back, “but i hate that, my name is Sen!” he put his hands around my shoulders. the metal felt cool and soothing, i realised my skin was boiling hot. “oh god, can you touch my face? my skin is SO hot, i’m burning up!” he placed both of his palms against my cheeks, it felt like my skin must be melting and dribbling down his wrists like icecream. “my skin feels like it’s dribbling down your wrists, like icecream!” i yelled, an inch away from his face. “i don’t know what you mean!” he started kissing me. my tongue dryly thudded around inside his mouth, like i was looking for a lightswitch in a foreign metal room. “holy shit, i am so thirsty!” i said, “sorry i need to find something to drink right now,” we stopped kissing. he laughed and disappeared backwards into the red darkness. i stood up and my legs were substantially different lengths. there was a bottle on the table next to me that had one mouthful of beer left and a cigarette butt floating inside, i pressed my teeth together as i was drinking it to filter out the butt and the ash, allowing liquid to pass through. ‘everyone will know i am so bohemian’, i thought smugly to myself. the amphetamines had started winning the race war and my brain was a molten hot piece of glass, crystal clear and expanding in every direction simultaneously. i scanned the desert horizon for another oasis. “god damn it demons, i need WATER!” i screamed at a pack of dogs making sand angels in the carpet. the music was wicked hypnotic and my body parts all took up instruments in the band. “where is the bathroom!” i shouted at something inanimate. my legs were on the bass drum and shot me forwards in low thumping rhythm. “are you keeping it from me, demon?” my snares, formerly hands, snapped on the shoulder of each passer by. fingers rolling across their skin in intricate hat patterns. “oh shit, it’s you!” a huge demon stopped me and came in for an embrace. he was honestly enormous, for a moment i disappeared into his body like i was returning to the womb. “can you help me find the bathroom?” i cooed into his bosom. “of course my little celebrity, do you want to climb on?” “AAAH!” i screamed and scrambled up his mountainous back. with our newfound height i could really get the lay of the land. evidently i had only made it a few feet from where i started, but it was a truly historic journey. i could see the girl with the nipples and her demons, rolling around on the desert floor far below me. my old beer bottle was there next to them, a speck in the distance. i squeezed my steed tight, “ONWARDS!” and we were off in a canter. our bodies aligned seamlessly, i clasped my forearms in my hands and wrapped my legs around his waist. my feet met flat against each other, sole to sole, and my toes perched together atop the bulge of his penis like birds on a wire. we crashed through the bathroom door and i flung myself off him, landing elegantly on the shiny floor tiles. it was immediately clear that my horse was interested in more than just a transportation based relationship. his dinnerplate hoofs slid all around my jumpsuit, looking desperately for some kind of entrance. unfortunately for both of us, i couldn’t see him as anything other than a demonic chariot rearing on two legs. not to mention that the bathroom lighting was piercingly unflattering, the pores in his skin looked fingernail sized and might as well be oozing. “sorry my friend i need to use the bathroom,” i said bluntly. he was busy attempting to twist my outfit open like a jar lid. “how the fuck do your clothes work?” for a second the random number generator determining my emotions rolled a dud, and i started to get scared that this might be a Bad Situation. “yeah it’s tricky- hey, i really need to go to the bathroom,” i said again, with early stage panic in my voice. he was actually listening to me this time, probably hoping for some kind of clue about how to solve my jumpsuit. “oh! sorry. i didn’t-” his footlong  fingers uncurled themselves from my inner thigh, “well, good luck! i don’t think you’re getting out of that thing without a pair of scissors. you might need to just play the hand you’re delt and shit yourself,” his deep laugh boomed off the tiles in the bathroom with a deafening echo. “come find me later, little celebrity,” he smiled, disappearing backwards out the door and shutting it behind him. i swooped over and quickly locked it. the random number generator quickly swung back to elation, and i determined that he might be the nicest man alive. now, i need to address this ‘bathroom’ for a minute. what the hell kind of nerve does a room have to act like that? bright and hard and clean and reflective!? i (allegedly) caught a glimpse of myself  in the mirror- it’s surely illegal, or at least indescribably immoral, to look quite this undone. my jumpsuit was drenched in cold sweat, clinging to every contour of my malnourished, sallow, barely pubescent-ass skeleton-ass fucking hollowed corpse-ass fuck, wasted ass whithered ass skin bone, fuck carcass ass shit. holy god in heaven i am the demon. hair melted onto my forehead like black ink on yellow snow, and the eyes. oh god my eyes. mile wide moons of unblinking blood. it was me all along Mirror, you smug bastard. casting judgement on all the demons in the desert, judgement at my loving horse and all his oozing pores. it’s all just so clear now isn’t it, Mirror? you vile serpent. well, now the joke is on you, fool. so busy mocking me, you didn’t notice what you have become yourself. a mirror is only as beautiful as its reflection, isn’t it, Demon? i might just stay here forever and trap you in my cursed image. this was my plan all along, and you played right into it! Ha- Ha Ha! 
i snapped out of it and realised i had just been standing there for minutes, looking myself in the eyes with a wide, terrifying toothy grin. i awkwardly returned my face to a neutral position, trying to look as boring as possible. it felt like i had gotten caught by someone doing something i wasn’t supposed to be doing, i quickly closed my eyes and spun around. things were much better when i opened them again, there was the sink and i darted towards it. for a split second when i arrived i thought ‘am i here to vomit?’, but i wasn’t. i turned on the tap and flipped my head upside down. the goal was to drink so much water that it filled me all the way up from my genitals to my mouth, and then shut them both tightly forever. 

8. tangential thoughts

all you need is a plan, a plan with steps. every drug has its intended effect, and then one or many side effects to be mitigated. it’s easy, if you are going to take a drug that causes unintended anxiety, you prepare for this by taking another drug with an intended calming effect. the one class of drugs that can’t fit cleanly into this equation is hallucinogens. i guess you could say that “epiphanies” are the intended effect, regardless of how thoughtful you are about them. a basic person can still enjoy the sensational novelty of an epiphany, even if they lack the insight to actually gleen anything from it. somebody might say something embarrassing like, “isn’t it crazy that we’re all like, alive in the universe right now?” and a stunned silence comes over the room. you’re paralyzed by the sheer scale of life, enormous and insignificant. almost immediately the thought passes, and now you’re all off thinking about the texture of the walls or whatever else for hours. some kind of measure of a person can be taken by how much these epiphanies stick with you afterwards, but what kind of measure? i’m not sure. someone who forgets them entirely is doomed, or blessed, to live a relatively thoughtless life. reflexive but pure, like a dog. then on the opposite end of the spectrum you have the clinically insane. so burdened by insight that they tumble down into lovecraftian madness, or worse: become so annoying that they ‘elevate’ even the most harmless conversation into some kind of faux-profound spiritual masturbation session. by some strange luck, the sweet spot on this spectrum happens to be ‘Me’. neatly relegating basically everybody else into the stupid, annoying, or insane categories. all this to say, one major side effect of hallucinogens is almost impossible to mitigate chemically, and that is ‘tangential thoughts’. every new object, environment, person, sound, texture, or even idea that you encounter becomes your Thing. an endless parade of joyful or horrifying Things narrows your mental aperture to a pinprick, and at that point you are functionally 
useless. you can’t think straight, you can’t have an intelligible conversation, you can’t feel the time, you can’t remember what you were doing or why, and you’re completely certain that whatever it was, it was extremely important. this feeling on its own is already too much to handle, so what kind of soulless, soulless god damn demon would combine it with the raw, barbaric urgency of AMPHETAMINES?? i sat on the toilet with the lid down, hands balled up in fists, smashing down on my own thighs over and over again. all you need is a plan, a plan with steps. that’s why the Speed is good right now, it helps with the steps. it keeps you on track. on track with the steps. i bit down gently on my cheek in rhythm with the fist hitting the thigh, every third beat i bit down on my tongue a tiny bit harder, then back to gentle on the cheek. one, two, bite- cheek, two, bite. plan, two, bite. “this isn’t progress,” i said to the toilet, “but i am in perfect rhythm.” 
after a few minutes or possibly weeks i was standing up and the plan was complete. it turned out there were only three steps: 1: find Antina. 2: buy Mdaz: 3, go home.
steps 1 and 3 were both optional, ‘nice to haves’. she would be perfectly fine without me, and i would be perfectly fine sleeping in an elevator. regardless, that was the plan. i summoned all my courage and made sure not to look back at the mirror as i slunk over to the door. i felt a wave of relief wash over me when i unlocked it and slipped out, safely back in hell. “oh my god, don’t- it’s a nightmare in there!” i blurted out to a girl who was waiting to go in. “were you giving birth? i’ve been standing here forever! oh, it’s you-” i couldn’t tell if she was angry, for some reason i bowed at her in response. the party seemed a little less demonic than before, people were relaxed around on couches and the ground in fun looking conversations. in fact, there were many little tangentially alluring things going on. two bots were arm wrestling at the table and people were throwing down tokens, betting on the winner. a line was even forming behind both of the bots, like you could get in on the action if you wanted to. the girl with the nipples was flipped over on her stomach and somebody was massaging her bare butt, a small line also seemed to be forming for that activity. everywhere i looked there was yet another diversion to get mixed up in- devilishly fascinating diversions! i could have my arm ripped off by a bot, squeeze the butt, or maybe even get my own butt squeezed, all while smoking the longest most delicious cigarette possible. there were certainly enough interested squeezers waiting to squeeze. my mind reeled at all the possibilities. this was like a debauched pirate ship, and who am i? just some sweaty little skeleton with ‘a plan’. well, that’s not fair. i didn’t know any of this was on the menu when i made the plan! it was a whole different universe inside that cruel, demented cell of a bathroom. can the plan even be trusted anymore if ‘get butt squeezed’ wasn’t considered during the deliberations? this is a bureaucratic nightmare. i shriveled to the ground and pulled a sad looking bent cigarette out of my kangaroo pocket. it was damp and warm inside, presumably like a real kangaroo’s pouch. the cigarette smelled like my sweat. i sat there waiting for it to somehow light itself, and thought through any potential additions to the plan. i did a mental comparison of the girl’s butt VS my own (imagined) butt, and quickly determined that i was not in anywhere near an appropriate state to be squeezed. she looked like a perfectly carved sculpture of rolling crimson hills, slowly erupting from the carpet. i would have been the cold, wet corpse laying next to her. that’s OK. it’s good to find things like that out early- as soon as possible really. imagine if a line had formed behind her and i was just waiting there, unsqueezed, surrounded by cartoon flies. “hey, do you need a light?” a strange little man was standing over me, he had just finished his turn at the butt squeezing. i didn’t hear him at first so he repeated himself. “oh, yeah. thanks. sorry i was lost in thought, nice uh- nice work over there.” he lit my cigarette, his hands were all oiled up and fragrant. i didn’t realise there was oil involved, it made the whole thing seem way less spontaneous. way weirder. “no problem,” he said, “you waiting to have a play?” his vibe was extremely off putting, scraggly facial hair and hungry little eyes. a ‘play’? i realised immediately i had been picturing this whole scene all wrong. in my mind it was cute, she was cute and the participants were cute too. but of course it’s like this. of course he’s some oily little weirdo. they’re all oily little weirdos, and she’s probably not even conscious. “no, i’m actually leaving,” i stood up quickly. he whined, “aww, so soon?” as i escaped his rancid aroma. my commitment to the plan is rock solid. the plan and the steps. ‘oily molestation’ was not included in the plan for a reason. i weaved through the humming crowd, puffing my cigarette aggressively in contempt for that man. one of the bots lost his arm wrestle in really dramatic fashion and clattered onto the ground at my feet, some little metal bits popped off of him and rolled away in random directions. “oh fab, my screws..” he moaned, clutching his arm and lumbering along the floor after them. i thought about what it would be like having a body made of replaceable parts. if you don’t like something about yourself, just swap it out! that sounds good, but then i bet there would always be a new problem. things not matching each other, feeling different, jealousy over parts other bots have that you don’t. as a person, at a certain point you just have to throw your hands up and say ‘i guess this is what i got’ and make your peace with it. one of the bot’s screws had rolled under my foot, i picked it up and passed it to him. “oh wow- it’s you. thanks kid.” he plucked the bolt off my palm gingerly, like my body was made of glass and liable to shatter at the slightest touch. “sorry you lost,” i said, “is your arm okay?” he slid the bolt into a little hole on his elbow and spun it tight with his index finger. “this is trivial. unfortunately it’s going to be a lot harder to screw my ego back together,” he was charming. i wanted be charming back, but i somehow remembered the plan, “hey, do you know a girl called Antina? have you seen her?” he flexed his arm backwards and forwards, it made a dull clicking noise. “that sound is going to drive me crazy. Antina? Antina, yeah, i know her.. you probably can’t see anything from down there, huh little buddy? must be frustrating,” he slowly rotated his head around like a lighthouse, absentmindedly clicking his arm. “i don’t think she’s here, did you look in Nik’s room? i can take you there,” i said yes please and thanked him. he offered his enormous hand for me to hold, and it was probably the most delicate hand holding experience i’ve ever had. i think he was just scared of accidentally hurting me, but it came across like extreme tenderness and made me feel very special. ‘i am in love with this gigantic robot,’ i thought to myself, as he carefully led me through the crowd. 

9. work

“are you fuckin’ serious kid?” Nik’s voice was muffled, howling at me behind a thick layer of protective glass. “you come in here last night, without the tokens. back in here tonight- again, without the tokens. you bring her in here, she doesn’t have the tokens,” he stuffed another pinch of Speed into his pipe, “so yeah, it pisses me off Sen. it pisses me off because of course every braindead maid from 300 comes in here asking to tick,” he paused briefly to inhale, the smoke went into him but seemingly didn’t need to come out again. “-but i expect that from them. they’re desperate, they’re workers. you are not a worker, are you kid? no no, you’re ‘The Baby’! Momma’s fuckin’ Baby, right Sen? so when you started coming in here, i thought to myself, great-” the smoke finally started trickling out, “lucky me, right? here’s a cute kid that will actually have a damn wallet for a change, not like the rest of these fuckin’ leeches. so in you come, doing my drugs, throwing up on my furnature, stumbling around like a fuckin’ celebrity, yet somehow you’re always ‘skint’, just like the rest of them. how does that work, Sen? explain it to me. explain to me how i can walk out of my room and see a fuckin’ oil painting of you as a baby in the hallway, and yet somehow you don’t even have enough tokens to cover yourself, or your little leech whore.” Antina was propped up beside me, woozing in and out of consciousness. i had my arm wrapped around her shoulder to stop her from falling off the chair. “it’s not like that,” i said feebly, “i mean, i don’t just magically have a bunch of tokens like that. i get some, sometimes, when i go up. but i haven’t been up in a while because it’s so far, and-” Nik punched the protective glass in frustration. the muffled thump briefly jolted Antina awake, her eyes flicked wildly around the room in panic then slid closed again. one of Nik’s meaty looking goons was watching us from a couch in the corner of the room, he also got a fright and sat up straight. “that’s exactly the kind of story i have no sympathy for,” he hissed, loading his pipe again. “when you say shit like that to people, i’ll tell you what they hear. they hear ‘i’m too lazy to act like i’m not special’. you choose to live on the 300s, right kid? you choose to live this far below your big pile of privilege, right? so it’s time to either start acting like you actually belong here, or fuck off right back to Momma’s tit.” my eyes were burning. i was glad Antina was unconscious because getting yelled at is  really embarrassing, especially when the theme of the yelling is ‘you are a spoiled child’. it really couldn’t have been happening at a worse time too. the mod drugs were rapidly fleeing my system, leaving a bottomless, gnawing pit of darkness behind. i was trying to think of something to do in response to what was happening, but my brain kept offering me ‘start crying’ as its only suggestion. i really didn’t want to start crying. if someone accuses you of being a spoiled child and you burst into tears, that’s it- you’re cooked. so let’s go for Plan B, brain, pretty much any plan other than crying or shitting myself will be fine. “OK,” my voice was wobbly, “OK, what do i do then?” solid three out of ten response, no crying. Nik was just staring at me, drumming his knuckles on the glass. “who are all those people out there at this party tonight?” i didn’t know if i was supposed to answer or not, so i just waited for him to keep talking. “they’re workers, kid. they’re maids, farmers, cooks, off duty Sec- whatever, i don’t ask. the point is, they all worked today so they could come here tonight and get high. that’s their reward. i’m a worker too, this conversation with you right now is Work,” he leaned back in his chair, and the vibe in the room felt a little less scary than before. Antina mumbled in her sleep. “so you ask me ‘what do i do’, and this is what i’m telling you- you work for your reward. just like everybody else out there tonight,” my mind immediately started whirring with ideas. i pictured myself in a series of increasingly hilarious uniforms. “but the problem is kid:  you’re useless- i mean that in an objective way. you have no use. no abilities, no skills to speak of, correct?” i was honestly not even insulted, he had my measure alright. i’m small, not strong, not particularly smart, not very charismatic.. i can’t even think of more adjectives. i do believe that people grow to meet the challenges they’re faced with in life, so by that logic it makes perfect sense really. i never needed to be anything in particular for anyone at all, so i sort of just developed at a mediocre level across the board. pretending otherwise would be unsightly, not to mention rude, to people with harder lives than mine which is damn near everybody. “that’s more or less accurate, yeah.” i said sheepishly. “more or less accurate,” Nik laughed. “that’s funny Sen. people know who you are, and they like having you around. i guess you could call that a skill.” he drummed his knuckles on the glass again. i just stayed quiet. Antina pressed her head into my shoulder, breathing deeply. i was jealous. i think she must have had some kind of Fent concoction, not whatever cursed tweaker shit they gave me. i felt like an alert lizard in a wet fluffy costume. “let’s just go with what you’ve got then. those little leech fucks in 327.10 owe me at least two hundred tokens- Tucky, how many tokens at 10?” the meat goon quickly jerked upright, “umm, two hundred and thirty tokens, twenty five. i mean, or that minus five. i mean- either two hundred and thirty or two hundred and twenty five, i’m sure.” Nik winced and snapped at him, “god dammit man! when i ask you questions like that, just say one number. i don’t even care if it’s the right one. i just want to hear a fuckin’ number.” 
“i’m sorry boss..” he looked truly heartbroken, “you’ve told me before and i did it again and i didn’t mean to Nik.. i just get all tangled up with my words..” my whole perception of the goon changed instantly: he is my little baby. he must be safe and warm! i might have just been projecting, but i think Nik was also a little taken aback by how stupid and cute the goon was. “it’s OK, let’s just go with the bigger number. two thirty. so this is what you do: you go over there, room 10, you get them to give you the tokens- Digs, that’s the name of the main guy. you tell Digs you’re there for the tokens, you get the tokens, you come back here, we call it even. hell, better than even. i’ll give you pottles to take home. that’s your work, kid.” it sounded good to me. room 10 is just down the hall, and pottles to take home sounded beyond good. i started to agree, “premium, i-” but Tucky (angel) interrupted, “uh boss, sorry for- i mean. i’m worried because of Digs, and the Baby. if something happens, and Sec comes for Digs, and Digs talks to Sec about us.. that’s bad, bad for us.” i didn’t understand what the precious little treasure was worried about, Digs narking to security about drugs? that doesn’t make sense, Digs bought the drugs. plus all the security people also get drugs from Nik. i didn’t get it. “wait, what’s the problem?” Nik ignored me and turned to Tucky, “he wouldn’t, not with the kid. the old whale upstairs would have an army down here. even Digs isn’t burnt out enough to do something that stupid.” Tucky didn’t look comforted. “do what?” i was still confused.
“well, there have been problems before at 10. the problems revolved around Digs, and his communication style,” Nik was speaking with a very deliberate tone, as deliberate as possible while chain smoking Speed pipes anyway. “his communication style was.. uncooperative, with the last two guys i sent there.”
“he stabbed ‘em!” Tucky wailed, “stabbed ‘em all up..”
“stabbed them all up!?” i turned to Nik, “what the fuck! i don’t want that! why would you send me there to get all stabbed up? look at me! i couldn’t take it. i’m basically on death’s door already, un-stabbed!” i think Nik couldn’t pick between an authoritative or sympathetic response, so he kind of just split the difference, “shut the fuck up- you’ll be fine! Tucky is just spooking you, Tucky, shut the fuck up. it’s like i was saying. Digs has enough sense to know it’s game over for him if he tries to pull something like that. nobody has the guts to lay a finger on you,” i was not consoled, “but what if he doesn’t recognize me? what if he thinks i’m just one of your numbskull goons? not like you Tucky! i mean the other ones.” Tucky looked betrayed. i am a monster. “i don’t know kid- bring the fuckin’ painting of you as a baby for all i care.” i couldn’t tell if he was joking or not, and had so many more anxious questions. “we’re done talking about this. look, Sen, it’s going to be fine. Digs might be a little prickly, but you’ll be all cute and lovable and get the tokens and it’s going to be fine. it’s time for you to go now,” Nik stood up and started walking to the back door on his side of the protective glass, “and the girl stays here- she’s your collateral. you can’t run away from this, kid.” the door slammed shut behind him and Antina fidgeted restlessly in her sleep. she probably wouldn’t have been able to walk for an hour or two anyway, so the whole ‘collateral’ thing was pretty symbolic, and besides i wasn’t exactly worried about her. Nik is a criminal, and you wouldn’t want to mess with him, but he wouldn’t actually do anything bad to Antina to teach me a lesson or anything. that’s not his style, he’s more of a ‘passive aggressive revenge’ kind of  guy. Tucky lumbered over to me and started poking at my arm, “you’ve gots to go,” he said softly. “okay, keep an eye on her while i’m gone. you don’t really think Digs will stab me up, do you Tucky?” i slid my arm out from under Antina and gently lay her down flat on the chair. “oh gosh.. i hope not. he’s a really horrible guy. doesn’t like to laugh or nothing. i wouldn’t never want to be his friend. are you going to bring the painting like boss said? so’s he knows who you are?” 
“i don’t think so. Nik might have been joking about that, i feel like he might be more likely to stab me if i walk in carrying a painting of myself.” Tucky shifted his weight backwards and forwards on his feet nervously, fiddling around in his jacket pocket. “uh, maybe you should take this with you.. just in case. in case he doesn’t know who you are on account of the fuzzy getup you’re in or something..” he produced a small, oval-ish rectangle-ish object from his pocket and hesitantly passed it over to me. it was black with a flat button on the side. “it’s a cutter,” he said, pointing at the button with his adorable finger. i pressed it and a shiny little metal blade popped out the end. “i use it for cutting up stuff, boxes and stuff. not people.. but it could cut up people..” there was a fearful sadness in his voice. mine would have sounded the same, but i couldn’t think of anything to say. 

10. ugly violence

i don’t like the direction of this storyline at all. when you are buying illegal drugs, it’s almost inevitable that there is some ugly violence happening somewhere down the line from your part in the whole process- this fact is unavoidable. you can easily put it out of your mind though, by knowing that there are at least a few people between you and wherever the ugly violence is happening. you aren’t doing it, your dealer isn’t doing it, ideally their supplier isn’t doing it, and anything beyond that is so far away that it is none of your business. maybe those guys are best friends, maybe they’re murdering each other, who knows. i am not invited, and that’s fine by me. so this, this cutter. this is the opposite of distance. this is a bad pun about ‘cutting out the middleman’. this is the kind of object that is thoroughly unaligned with the cutiepie lifestyle. this is the kind of no good object that the no-goods use for no good stuff in whatever no good place they are at, again- none of my business. i thought about throwing it away immediately, but then my mind started offering me all manor of horrifying scenarios. ‘if only i had that cutter, i might just survive this’ type situations. ugly situations that, AGAIN- i have no god damn business being in. also i need to make it very clear, this isn’t an extension of the ‘spoiled baby’ stuff from before. you don’t immediately transition from ‘spoiled baby’ to ‘blade combat baby’ in a single step. there is an entire range of babies between those two ends of the baby spectrum. i would land somewhere perfectly in the middle, because not wanting to kill or die doesn’t make you a coward, it makes you fucking normal. pretending otherwise is Big Man stuff. puffing out your chest, walking like the sheer momentum of your swinging testicles alone is enough to propel you forwards through life. ‘every problem looks like a pussy when all you’ve got is a fat cock’, Big Man stuff. i call it phallic solipsism: fuck everything that you come into contact with until it’s either submissive, or dead- doesn’t matter which! you’re the Big Man after all. this is the kind of caveman behavior that we are supposed to have evolved past by now, thousands of years ago. brother, we already tried it. generations of bashing each others heads in with rocks got boring then, eventually, we developed language, communication and cooperation. now you want to go back to the rocks?? is using words to express your emotions really so hard that you prefer the heads-and-rocks strategy, Big Man? oh yeah, but I’m the baby, sure. i guess i’m the baby because talking about your feelings is too Scary, right? i’m the baby because outcomes for people other than me are actually taken into consideration. i’m the baby because when somebody says “i want to fucking fight him” my response is “that’s fucking embarrassing” because Big Man, i’m sorry to say, you are embarrassing. maybe we can cordon off a section of the world for you, you and all the other Big Men can go bash each other with rocks all you like, (don’t worry: absolutely nothing gay will happen there), and the rest of us can live in peace. talking, like the cowardly little babies we are.

11. a knockout

the party was lousy with a very uneasy kind of person when i emerged from Nik’s room, and luckily i fit right in. it’s a truly unique sensation coming down from amphetamines: one third aimlessness, one third urgency, and a mysterious final third that is completely unaccounted for. you’re missing something, something that isn’t life threatening necessarily, but you’re not going to just sit there and not know where (or what) it is. so you’re looking, and loads of things are nearly it- but no, no not quite. it’s important that you find it soon though, because you can’t just feel like this forever. ‘Searching’ is an unsustainable activity, and it only gets more unpleasant the longer you do it. listening to music doesn’t work, because the next song is always the one you might actually want to hear. same goes for anything you could watch on a screen, and (of course) eating is totally out of the question. you’re pretty sure you don’t want to be in a different location, but here is definitely no good either.. why can’t it be like it was before? up until recently, very recently actually, everything was exactly what you wanted to be doing. it didn’t even matter what it was! god damn, those were the days, weren’t they? the world was just one big, fat, juicy-ass carrossel of deliciously stimulating situations. each one more deliciously stimulating than the last. ‘boom’ ‘boom’ ‘boom’, but you can’t remember exactly when that stopped happening. it wasn’t sudden, and it wasn’t gradual. it’s almost like you retroactively were never having a good time at all, and most likely never will again. how could you ever escape feeling like this? you couldn’t. ‘oh shit, wait, what if i had more amphetamines? i felt great before and i feel terrible now, so the thing i’m missing must be more amphetamines. occam's razor!’ this, of course, is stupid. the thing that you’re ‘missing’ won’t come back when you have more amphetamines, because it’s gone. you gobbled it all up. normally, without drugs, your brain doles out those deliciously stimulating feelings in (frustratingly) tidy little portions. the brain is judicious with these portions for a reason: you don’t have much, and it takes a while to make more. that’s too boring for you though, obviously. ‘selfish brain, trying to squirrel away all those fun feelings for yourself, huh? well, i’ll show you!’ and so you heist the bank- take ‘em for every god damn feeling in the joint. after blowing through it all in about an hour in a half, you decide that maybe it’s time to heist the bank again. but there’s nothing in the bank, dumbass! you saw to that already. it’s just an empty vault and a bunch of confused employees wondering where all the money went. anyway, there are some lessons in life that you need to learn over and over again. there is a big difference between “knowing” something on an intellectual level, and “knowing” something in a way that actually changes the way you behave. i darted across the room in a series of small, irregular spasms. back to where i started. the girl with the nipples and the oily man were both gone; replaced by some uncertain looking people, uncertainly smoking cigarettes. “hey,” i said, gesturing at a pile of discarded garbage on the table, “is, uh..” my question is hard to articulate, the long and short of it being: is it okay if i rummage through this trash in an attempt to have your(?) drugs in a way that is not like stealing, but more like salvaging, like a public service. “is anyone using that.. things?” nobody answered, but they did look at me with a sort of hollow acknowledgement in their eyes, then looked away. i interpreted this as a good sign and started rummaging. i found basically an entire dose worth of Speed spread across several different, mostly empty pottles. i unceremoniously slurped it all up into my pen and down my line, as if by having it really quickly i would appear less desperate. ‘oh, this? ha ha, barely even noticed i was doing it. couldn’t care less, frankly’. i was definitely oozing that kind of energy. nonchalant- maybe even a little bored, in a cool way. and by the way, fuck all that stuff i was blabbing on about earlier. there’s plenty of feelings left to heist, i feel good; i feel fast! i make it through all those indecisive losers and over to the door and out it and into the hallway in probably 3.5 seconds, maybe even less. the hallway is humming at me and i’m humming back. the cold concrete is there again, but it feels good on my feet. they’re wet and slapping and i’m a penguin on the ice ready to do a belly slide like in those nature videos. i run past a couple of bots and to them i am probably just a furry little blur. you couldn’t even make out my features (sad for you), but they’re excellent as they’re whizzing by. something catches my eye and i slam on the breaks, presumably leaving a trail of brilliant sparks flying out behind me. it’s me. the painting of me as a baby, that is. on the wall, right outside of room 10. i’m legitimately newborn in it, sleeping splayed out on a cream rug next to a green plant- bare ass out. it’s almost vulgar. the kind of painting that would be inappropriate if it were of an adult, but for some reason it’s fine when it’s a baby, so long as you don’t think about it too much. i replay the audio clip in my brain of Nik saying that i should take it, show it to Digs like it’s my ID. is it stupid, or is it hilarious? like the kind of thing an absolute knockout would do, and you’d go ‘wow, they’re either insane, or insanely confident,’ and i’m undeniably both right now. i could still be absolutely terrified for all i know, but if i am, that emotion isn’t doing a good enough job at advertising itself. i’m throwing all my chips down on the mood with the most overt marketing campaign, the one that grabs the microphone and shouts ME ME ME! SEN! PICK ME! and i guess that makes it an easy decision. i guess i’m a knockout. getting the picture off the wall proves harder than expected, it’s.. affixed, somehow. duh, duh duh duh. just let anybody snatch it off and take it home whenever they want? obviously not. it begs the question though: if somebody did do that, would i be flattered or disgusted? being identified (correctly) as a sex symbol, flattering. as a baby sex symbol? more complicated. or, no. what am i saying, not complicated at all- obviously bad! my fingernails slid blindly around the edges of the painting, sinking in to something slightly squishy, some kind of glue. “the cutter!” i exclaimed to naked baby me. as i was fumbling around in my kangaroo pocket to find it, i discovered that at some point i had inadvertently stolen somebody’s lighter. a nifty little metal number with a picture of a palm tree printed on it. “haha, right on!” i lit one of my sweaty cigarettes, me and the baby were having a great time. squink! out came the little metal blade from the cutter. it was easy and fun slicing around the glue, maybe this could be my job? this is the life alright. actually no, sudden disaster. i was clasping the cigarette in my teeth and a big ribbon of non-inhaled smoke wound itself up, directly into my eyes. then, simultaneously, the cutter sliced straight through the last remaining bit of glue and directly into my fingers, which were waiting patiently for their turn to be sliced on the other side. then (basically also simultaneously), the painting, which turned out to be really heavy, was freed from its glue and smashed down triumphantly onto the knuckles of my toes. within the space of less than a second i was blinded, bleeding and hobbled. i desperately rubbed at my stinging eyes in an attempt to sooth them. the eyes, unsoothed, were now coated in blood. really it was amazing i had any to spare, because it felt like every last drop was racing down my body, straight to the feet. a perfect white line was swelling up along almost all of my toes except for the pinkies, and along the center of the line were tiny little blooming jewels of blood. expanding like wet red balloons until they got too heavy, then slipping between my toes down onto the carpet. “holy shit my god!” i screamed and fell backwards onto my ass. it felt like all of my extremities were trying to break up with me, flat out. that’s it, we’ve had enough of you. hands: i’m leaving, feet: goodbye, eyes: fuck you. the painting of me as a baby had somehow started crushing me too, it must have been leaning on me and then seen an opportunity to pounce when i fell- exploiting my moment of weakness. it was during this moment of weakness that i, laying on the floor, covered in blood, slowly being flattened by a tastefully erotic infant nude, managed to open my eyes enough to see that i was actually making an incredibly memorable first impression. 
“the fuck.. the fuck is all this??” Digs was standing in his doorway, understandably impressed. like i said; a knockout.   

12. control

i’ve only been in actual danger a few times in my life. your brain will often claim that you are in danger, but i think it’s one of those things you can only know for real in retrospect. the first time it happened i was about half as old as i am now, my minder had taken me with her down to the markets around 220. on the higher floors you have more established shops run by the hotel itself, chain stores with regular schedules and assigned security. the further down you get they start to disappear and the businesses are just run by people- proactive people or bots who just took it upon themselves to run them. there is still security, but a lot less of it, and everyone basically exists on their own momentum. as i’ve said before, the accounts you hear on the rich floors of how dangerous it is down there are bullshit. they get off on gossiping about it. quivering fatsos in the casino one-up each other with increasingly fantastic accounts of things “they’ve” “seen”. i guess it makes their status all the more sweet, imaging poor people as literal animals fighting over crumbs of rotten bread. well, it’s not like that, but deprivation can cause people to do dark stuff they wouldn’t otherwise do. it was the furthest down i had ever been as a child, my minder said i would like seeing the markets because we didn’t have anything like them up top. after descending some 250 flights of stairs you enter a kind of trance-like madness, it feels like you have always been going down the stairs and you will only ever be going down the stairs and there is nothing else out there in the universe except for you and the stairs. it’s repetitive and boring, but if you stop paying attention you will trip and hurt yourself, so you just have to focus intentionally on how boring it is. being a young child too, my legs were small and i figured i was probably having to work twice as hard as my minder to make it down, or maybe half as hard because i was half the size? when we finally arrived at the hallway door my body was playing tricks on me, like it was at risk of sinking through the floor out of habit. my minder, Miss Tilly, gave me a drink of water and a fruit leather. she didn’t look tired, people who live on the lower floors and work up high are fully immunised to the labor of the journey. “stay right behind me,” she said, placing the hem of her dress into my hand, “keep hold of this and stay right behind me.” i peeked under her dress, her calf muscles were massive, like a man’s arms. she had a no nonsense way about her, not mean but not affectionate. in reality Miss Tilly was probably not much older than i am now, but she had the personality of somebody who had already lived an extremely long and exhausting life. middle aged as a teenager then long dead by adulthood. i never knew anything about her or her family, if she had any. i didn’t even know if Tilly was her first or her last name. one day, ages earlier, she just showed up to replace the more-or-less interchangeable Miss Simone that took care of me before, then after that day at the market she was replaced by the more-or-less interchangeable Miss Marsh. this was how my entire life worked from birth until some unknowable amount of time ago: a woman named Miss ____ arrived and minded me, she gave me meals and lessons for reading, writing and math, then one day she was gone and a new woman picked up right where she left off. nobody ever told me who they were, why they left, or where they went. one day one of them was gone and nobody came to replace her, i guess when that happened i had transitioned through some kind of invisible barrier and popped out the other end as a “grown-up”. at first i thought that something was wrong, so i went up to ask Mom about it. she was busy and couldn’t see me, but one of her staff told me that everything was fine, that it wasn’t a mistake and not to worry. i didn’t want to make a fuss, so i just never asked about it again after that. i couldn’t help but notice that i was extremely not grown up. you instinctively know what an adult looks like, and i objectively did not look like them. this didn’t bother me for long though, because suddenly i could do whatever i wanted. it had always felt to me like something crucial was missing from my life, something intangible that other people had but i didn’t, and evidently that thing was drugs. as soon as i started getting so high that i couldn’t walk or speak i thought ‘ah, this is it!’ this is the little piece of the puzzle i spent my whole childhood searching for. that niggling feeling of boredom and emptiness that always lurked somewhere near by, just beyond the corners of my vision, i finally had a way to locate it- to muffle it. i’m not sure if everyone has that feeling and they’re just better at ignoring it, or if it’s a germ that only lives in certain people. sometimes when i’m feeling arrogant i think that people who don’t do drugs are lazy compared to me, me who is proactive. like they lack the motivation to fix whatever is making them feel bad, and are content to just linger in their sense of dissatisfaction. if you’re thirsty but can’t be bothered getting out of bed to get water: that’s laziness, we’d all agree. so by that same token if you are feeling anxious but can’t summon the motivation to leave the house and buy benzodiazepines, what’s the difference? somebody told me once that drug “addicts” as they called them are obsessed with control. like they become addicted to the notion that they can control the way that they feel, or want to feel, at any given moment. to me, framing this as some kind of bad thing comes across fundamentally ignorant or lazy like i said. i mean really, what you’re saying is that you can identify something bad that you are feeling, you know the thing you could do to fix it, and what? you intentionally linger in the bad feeling to prove some kind of point? and about what, because if it’s some bullshit about ‘control’ then you seem just as obsessed with it as me. i’m controlling myself to feel better and you’re controlling yourself to continue feeling sad- out of spite. that day with Miss Tilly was long before i figured any of this out though, i felt tired and a little bit scared, but mostly i was just excited in a wholesome way. i was clutching onto her dress as we immerged out of the hallway into the market plaza and all my senses burst to life. it was a huge space, multiple stories high and not lit up at the ceiling so it felt like you were outside at night time, like really outside. there were smells of weird food i had never smelled before that were gross but still exciting because they were new, and so many people. people and bots, all talking and laughing, some of them were arguing but somehow it was like friendly arguing. there were dozens of different stalls, heaps selling food and then weird little ones selling important looking pieces of plastic or metal bot parts. immediately my grip on Miss Tilly’s dress started loosening, like whatever predefined path she had us on was certain to be boring and i would discover a better one on my own. “hold on tight and stay right behind me,” Miss Tilly repeated. stupid hag, i thought to myself. she doesn’t know all the good places down here like i do. “where are we going?” i asked, eying up a stall that seemed to be selling tiny little men made of colorful glass. “the fabric merchant, some of the white linen that we-” one of the stands was piled high with melons. huge water melons and the green-grey ones that look like stone eggs. “use for setting the table. the prices on linen down here are-” another stall had posters behind the counter of women, naked women, clutching at their breasts and smiling. ‘linen’!? this bitch has it all wrong. here we are in what must be the most exciting place on earth and she has us on a collision course for LINEN. “far cheaper than the fabric stores on the 300s. in fact-” obviously everyone who says the lower floors are dangerous are dumb as rocks, or are intentionally trying to keep me away from fun things for some twisted adult reason. maybe they were forced to be bored as children and so are determined to enact that same fate on me as a dark recreation. i won’t entertain that! “almost twice as dear upstairs, ah, here we are,” we eventually arrived at a place that was more uninteresting than i even thought possible. rolls of identical beige material, devoid of any design or texture, stacked neatly against a wall. the merchant, an equally beige man, greeted Miss Tilly and began describing the material in painstaking detail. “the flat stitch roll is woven slightly tighter than our competitors, see it compared to this sample i have from Gregory’s? no, look closer- you see, it’s all about the age of the cotton when it is harvested. that and the dryness of course, there are really five key factors you want to look out for when it comes to moisture in cotton, number one-” the most perverse thing was that Miss Tilly seemed to be interested in this conversation, or capable of feining interest anyway, which was just as unthinkable. i used the unending beige monologue as an opportunity to gently uncurl my fingers from her dress, one by one. “of course, that’s not even to mention the soil! i’ve caught a peek at ol’ Gregory’s soil, and i don’t mind telling you that mother was dry as a mule’s ear, if you don’t mind my candor Miss-” his voice was slowly drowned out by the din of the market as i took sneaky steps backwards, then i turned and bolted down a side passage behind the stalls. a group of bots smiled at me, surely admiring my escape. walking behind the stands was thrilling, i could see the customers like from the merchants point of view. all the grubby little parts of the stall that normal people didn’t get to see, the bags where they keep the tokens, little notes reminding them of facts about the products. i stood and watched a trembling old man ladling out some brown liquid with chunks into a bowl from a big steaming pot. “two and a half thanks dear” he said to the customer, who fished around in her bag for money. ‘must be some good chunks,’ my stomach rumbled. i needed either: A some tokens, B some pity, or C to steal stuff. that’s the problem with being a child, i thought to myself, you’re always at the whim of some boring ass adult who has the money and boring ass priorities on how to spend it. if i had a bag of tokens right now this would likely be the best day of my life. first priority: something sweet to eat, not the brown liquid although i do want to know more about the chunks, something sweet, or really salty. second priority: awesome items, a little glass man, maybe a funny hat, maybe some of whatever was going on at that stall with the naked woman picture. actually, top-est priority: alcohols. if i want to do it right, i’ve got my bag of tokens of course, i’ve got my funny hat, and i’ve got what all the adults seem to want all the time, i’ve got my alcohols. “hey kid, what are you doing back here?” the old man with the chunks had turned around, trying to focus his useless old eyes on me. “what’s the chunks?” i said. “what’s the what, kid?” he couldn’t hear me with his useless old ears. “what’s the CHUNKS!” i gestured towards the pot. “chunks? it’s sweet potato kid, are you missin’ your mother or something?” sweet, potato? what is this old ghoul playing at, some kind of sugar soup? brown sugar, soup with potato. “it’s brown sugar soup?” we both looked at eachother, bewildered. “what the hell are you on about kid? brown sugar? i said sweet potato, where’s your mother? i know you ayn’t begging, not with a getup like that. you’s some lost angel baby, kid?” my clothes weren’t fancy, just clean. although looking around at everyone else in the market, at the other children, i would admit that i looked out of place. a little too fresh out of the packet. “it’s OK,” i reassured him, “i’m supposed to be here, my Mom sent me. can i try the sugar potato? she’s got the money- my Mom.” he ruffled my hair with his old useless hand, turning back towards the pot in shaky slow motion. i didn’t plan on stealing his bag of tokens, yes technically stealing a bag of tokens was option C in my plan, but not specifically his tokens and it was basically a joke when i thought it. really it was just shocking how slowly his body rotated, so shocking that i basically entered a state of panic, panic at how slowly he was moving. panic as you know causes people to do unexpected things, and for me the unexpected thing was grabbing his bag of tokens and slipping it into my underpants. i was just as surprised as anyone. he was so slow that i even had heaps of time left over to ponder how bad i was after i had finished doing the stealing. i wanted (again, not that i planned it) more of a ‘wow i only just got away with that’ moment, but i just had to stand there, lingering in the guilt. “here you go kid, it’s hot!” he offered out a trembling hand with a trembling stick with a chunk on it. i couldn’t take it from him, “t-thanks,” i muttered, “i’ll go get my Mom, i’ll be right back,” slipping out from behind the stall and back into the flow of customers, my crotch made a jingling sound. 

13. never eat a meal bigger than your head

i looked behind me and then in every direction frantically, as if someone, everyone, security, Miss Tilly, the chunk man, his chunks- of course they all knew immediately what i had done and it was only a matter of seconds before they shouted ‘HEY!” and i was toast. i kept walking forwards frantically, jingling. fucking jingling, like ding ding ding, here i am, come and get me! eventually nobody shouted hey, and my ratio of terror vs excitement started shifting. no one is coming. no one coming and i am rich! richer than a rich old fat bastard- straight to the melons. “one melon please,” i said proudly to melon man. “ayo little angel, what kind you like? we’ve got watermelon, and this is a cantaloupe, aka rockmelon. not many people know, a cantaloupe and a rockmelon are the same melon.” that’s true by the way. “one water melon please,” he proceeded to roll a watermelon about the size of my torso across the table. “okay angel, do you have money? it’s nine tokens.” ha, ‘do i have money’, who does he think i am? clearly he hasn’t heard that i’m a rich old fat bastard. i plunged my hand into my underpants and fumbled around. he looked immediately concerned, then mostly back to normal when i pulled out a fistful of shiny tokens. “oh- ah, ha ha, keeping them somewhere safe huh! you should invest in some pockets sweetheart, that’s why they call it pocket money. what you’ve got yourself there is fart money.” fart money! this guy is hilarious. he gets it, i thought to myself, slowly counting out nine tokens. “that’s twelve and a half,” he said, pushing them back. “no, it’s nine. one two three four five six seven eight nine,” 
“no, the big ones are two, and the small one is a half. see? one two there four, six, eight, ten, twelve and a half. this your first time paying for something yourself kid?” my cheeks went vibrant red, embarrassing myself in front of the melon man! of course the different sizes means different amounts of money. bigger and smaller! the rich old fat bastard disguise is blown and now the melon man knows i’m just a stupid child who can’t even count my fart money. “sorry..” i said sheepishly, “can you do it..” he laughed and passed some of the tokens back. i quickly stuffed them back into my underpants, avoiding eye contact. “enjoy the melon little friend, and don’t eat it all at once. remember, you should never eat a meal bigger than your head- it’s a rule to live by.” i thanked him and waddled away cradling my enormous melon. this day at the market was very formative for a bunch of reasons, which i will get to, but the ‘never eat a meal bigger than your head’ thing especially stuck with me. i have probably recited that sentence to a hundred different people since the melon man said it, because there is something fundamental about the rule, and to me at least; aspirational. the idea that i or anyone would have the self control to not eat the entire melon is insane, but it gives you something to strive for. you might not be the kind of person that can stop half way through the melon today, or tomorrow, but one day you could be that person. one day when your mind gets right and everything stops feeling so fucking urgent, you could eat a slice or two and then leave the rest for later. i’m not there yet though, and i wasn’t anywhere near that day at the market. that day, before i even had a chance to demonstrate my lack of self control, simply owning the melon was a burden. i could only carry it for small periods of time before i had to set it down and take a break, and eventually i resorted to rolling it into an alleyway with my foot. the outside was filthy, but it didn’t matter. ‘the treasure is safe within’. too safe! clawing at it with my fingernails, punching, sitting on it with all my weight and bouncing up and down. the melon was invisible. i will have to stash it here and come back with some kind of tool, i thought to myself, rolling the melon over to a pile of garbage and stashing it under some flat cardboard boxes. no problem, there are other things on my rich old fat bastard to-do list. i scurried back out into the flow of the market and let the tide of customers carry me away. it felt safer being surrounded by a group of tall people because certainly Miss Tilly was out there somewhere, searching for me. i situated myself in the middle of a group of three bots as they wandered down a branch of stalls i hadn’t seen, my head kept bumping up against one of their hard shiny legs. “oof, watch it- oh, hey cutie bug. you look familiar. you lost or something?” one of the bots had fixed her big glowing eyes on me. “i’m looking for.. i have a big water melon. but i can’t get it open, it’s too tough for me. but i really want to eat it- and also alcohol. i’m looking for it too, i have money but i don’t know where to buy it, and a hat, i think i need a hat-” she laughed and put her hand on my shoulder, “oh wow, you need to take it one problem at a time. you need alcohol?” her friends had started listening in too, two big boy bots with glittering dots, painted stripes and weird symbols, “don’t fuck with the kid, Ix.” one of them said, smirking at her. “i’m not, i’m helping it! what kind of alcohol do you like darling?” she’s being so nice to me, i thought to myself, and her name, so cool. “is your name is Icks? i’m Sen! i don’t know what kind i like, i don’t think i’ve had it, before. i want whatever a rich old fat bastard likes,” they all burst out laughing, these bots love me. just wait until they hear about my fart money, i schemed about how to tell them, as funny as possible so they will all laugh again like that. “well shit, you’re a superstar. you wanna be a fat bastard like those blood suckers up in the casino huh? what you like is whiskey, put some hair on your chest or milk in your tits or whatever the fuck kinda make you are, anyway,” i didn’t know what he meant by that last part, but it didn’t seem like my time to talk yet. “they do ‘em like that up top- can’t commit to a bool,” 
“maybe it makes them easier to trade, don’t need to work around so many preferences. one size fits all kind of logic,” 
“i don’t even think preferences exist for them, what’s the point, with unlimited resources?” one of them started talking in what i think was an impression of a rich person, “derrm, i can’t decide, just give me one of everything- oh gosh darn it, two of everything, Rachel! one for each of my wet fleshy balls.” they all laughed, i laughed too, for some reason. they looked down at me, maybe they forgot that i was there. “where can i find it?” i asked Ix, she grabbed my hand and squeezed it, painfully. “we’ll show you! you’ll be a fat bastard in no time.” we started weaving through the crowd, Ix pulled me along by my arm and i had to move really fast to keep up or it would pop off my body. “Sec sweeping up ahead,” one of the boy bots up in front loud whispered back to us. i could just see them, peering through the sea of legs. oh god, i thought, they’re looking for me. Miss Tilly must have told security that i ran away and now they’re hunting me down. my new friends didn’t seem keen on them either. “let’s cut through over here, we can go to the bar on the corner by the far stairs.” my arm violently wrenched to the right and we slipped behind a row of stalls. “oww!” i was trying to keep strong and quiet but it accidentally slipped out. “Ix you’re going to rip it’s arm off,” she looked down at my face and saw that i was in pain. “whoops sorry, maybe you should hold onto me instead. tight as you can, it’s OK. keep up little bug.” i gripped onto the bottom of her skirt and it reminded me of being with Miss Tilly, but when i peeked underneath her legs looked very different. they were dull grey and all scratched up, covered in weird stripes and symbols like the boy bots. i have never really seen up close to a bot like this before, i thought to myself, maybe all of their legs look like this? and she’s not wearing underpants! but maybe they don’t, bots, maybe they don’t wear underpants? i can see the part where her body becomes her legs, which i guess is her butt, but it doesn’t look how mine looks. it’s two clearly different parts fitting together. slightly different colors. i could hear the joints of her knees and her hips sort of swooshing as they moved backwards and forwards, like the sound of opening a cupboard. “are you looking up my skirt?” Ix had turned her head and was staring down at me, “hey Tezo, looks like you’ve got some competition, it’s trying to look up my skirt!” the boy bot up the front laughed, “get in line kid.” i started stammering something about how i wasn’t but nobody seemed to be paying attention anymore, we stopped moving very abruptly and i crashed into the back of Ix’s legs. “oof, OK, calm down. we’re here. shit- inside, inside,” a group of security officers had rounded the corner just down from where we were standing, Ix grabbed the back of my jumpsuit and we all barreled through the door. “Sec are swarming today, what the fuck is that about?” she said to Tezo, the leader boy bot, “i dunno. they haven’t been this hot in ages, probably just after a pickpocket in the market or something.” they’re after me. i felt scared but also kind of cool and important. extremely cool actually, my mind was whirring, here i am with my cool new robot friends inside a bar, everyone is looking for me, wondering where i am. i wanted to brag about it, tell them that i’m the star of the show everyone wants . . . but maybe they wouldn’t like that? they seem very scared of the security for some reason, they might not want to hang out with me if they knew. “maybe. i’m not sure, something feels off.” she was peering out the window, fidgeting with her fingers. “forget about it Ix, you’ll kill the vibe- our mammal here is on an important mission, remember.” Ix turned away from the window and looked at me, nodding her head vigorously, “yes, yes YES. go, find us a seat,” she said to me, “i’ll get the drinks. sorry- you’re right. this is important. it’s not every day you get to see a little bug transform into a fat bastard.” i smiled at her and wandered out of the entryway into the main hall of the bar. it was a dingy place, not like any of the bars i had seen upstairs. dim and messy. something about it was comforting, i felt like i could do whatever i wanted to and the room wouldn’t care. it had given up a long time ago and didn’t mind if you were in it or not. i sat down and watched the bots ordering from the bar. the table was sticky, i drummed my fingers up and down on it, feeling them stick ever so slightly and then unstick again. Ix was laughing with the bartender, who was also a bot, and they looked over at me. i smiled back at them, the bag of tokens was pressing into my stomach and made me need to pee. when my friends came back they were each holding two glasses, barely filled up with brown liquid. “okay, your time to shine kid, you got the money to pay for these?” i reached down and retrieved a handful of tokens, smashing them down on the sticky table. “right on fat bastard! these are all yours, here- we got you six.”
“all six, for me?” Ix smiled, “oh yeah, we don’t have the emu for alcohol yet, right guys?” the boy bots nodded, smiling. “yep, all yours! it takes about six for it to work, anyway.” 
bots install emulation systems for experiencing the effects of different things originally intended for people. at first this was all software emulation, and mostly based around taste and smell. software emulation basically just lets bots understand something on an intellectual level, like ‘this soup is too salty’ or ‘this room smells nice, like flowers’. i have taken drugs with bots before who clearly are only experiencing them through software emulation, they’ll say stuff like ‘oh wow, i feel so sleepy right now!’ but they’re not acting sleepy. they just have the data, data informing them that pipe they just smoked has sleepy . . . feelings, in it, or something. i’m not sure exactly what it’s like for them. the difference is extremely obvious though when a bot has the correct hardware emulation installed, they really feel it, just like a person does. someone told me once it basically works like an intentional malfunction, exposing parts of their system to be strategically impaired or disabled, temporarily. it’s funny really, and it made me think about my own body like that. a machine with parts that all work how they’re supposed to, then i deliberately sabotage them. these emulators used to be very expensive to install, and only the more high end bots could afford to get them fitted. these days though, they’re cheap. new bots will be built with them already installed, and almost all the old bots have got them put in. back then though, i’m not sure if Ix was lying. probably she was. 
“go on, get started! they might be a little spicy for you at first, it’s best to just have it all at once, don’t sip at it-” the bots were all standing, looking down at me at my sticky table with my six whiskies. “okay, thank you so much!” i picked up the first glass and i was confused by the system of putting lots of small amounts of liquid into several different glasses, it seemed like a waste of time. when i sniffed it, it smelled crazy, like electricity would smell. i shivered. “i’m a big rich fat old bastard!” i declared and glumped it down- immediately plunged into panic. it BURNS, it BURNS me. my throat felt like it was going to explode. it’s trapped in there still, it must be, trapped in my throat and burning me alive from the inside! i started coughing and spluttering and dribbling, the bots- my friends, all burst out laughing. Tezo slapped me on the back so hard my ribs hit the table. “that’s it little bastard! only five more to go!” i felt like i couldn’t breathe. “i need water-” my voice was tiny and raspy, “my mouth is burning!” the other bot who wasn’t Ix or Tezo went over to the bar and came back with some water, they were all still laughing and hooting uncontrollably. “okay take a drink and keep going, you’ve gotta have them all quick or it won’t work,” Ix said, patting me on the head. the water helped a lot, but i really didn’t want to do it again. i didn’t want to disappoint my friends though, we were all having such a good time and i knew if i didn’t have the rest they would be mad at me, probably not want to be friends anymore. the second drink was just as bad as the first one, they all erupted in laugher and cheers again as i spluttered, desperately gulping down more water. the bar tender looked wearily over at us, probably jealous about how much fun we were having together, i thought. as i was peering over at him, my head started to feel heavy, and slow, and i felt warm. i hiccuped and the sound made me laugh. “guys i think it’s working, i feel-”
“no, it won’t be working yet,” Ix said, “you’ve still got four more to go, it should start working soon.” 
“okay, i’m a fat bastard!” i said again, “bastard number three!” it was a little easier than the first two, my throat and mouth had burned so much now they were numb. my fingers felt numb too, and my face. the laughter of the bots felt like it was getting quieter and louder in waves, zooming in and then out again of my ears. “bastard number four!” i closed my eyes and could hear the blood pumping inside my head, i rubbed my hands across the surface of the sticky table. “rug gug gug gug gug, staa staa” i went with my lips, repeating the sound of my hands on the sticky table. “you guys are my best friends, best bots- best friends.” i said to the bots. they laughed again and sat down next to me, Ix put her arm around my shoulder. “we love you kid,” Tezo ruffled my hair. “bastard number five!” i shouted into the glass, “aaah! i’m like a dragon!” i imagined fire streaming out of my throat, burning the whole bar down. Ix kissed me on the cheek, and i immediately started blushing. it was probably unnoticeable though, i was boiling hot. my cheeks and forehead were glowing, my skin felt like it was going to burst out of my clothes and run away.
