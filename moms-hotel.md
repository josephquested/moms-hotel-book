MOM’S HOTEL












1. awake and falling

sometimes when i get high i swear i leave my body for real. not in some poetic way or anything like that, i honest to god feel myself leaving. or more like, i wake up once i’ve already left it a while ago. it’ll be that i’m way up above the hotel in the sky, way up above the roof so as i can see it down below and even the clouds look small and blurry. see it like a bird or like the moon would see it. the neon sign lights up all the fog until it’s thick pink foam and i can feel the outside air on my skin and in my nose. it’s so different to breathe than inside air that it’s hard to describe, like all my normal air has been dead for years and i’m just breathing on the corpse in and out. there is some places on the lower levels where people have bashed little cracks in the windows and i’ve tried to breathe from them before but you can tell it’s not outside air. if it was i would be able to tell straight away because i know what it feels like to breathe it when i’m awake and falling way up in the sky. 
after i’ve had my fill with looking i start to fall down at a speed which is somewhat under my control. the hotel is a little glowing black square way below until all of a sudden i’m slipping into the pink foam and it’s right in front of me. the glow of the neon sign stings my eyes which i think is no big deal, they probably didn’t figure on people getting so close to it on account of it being so high up. i always have a game where i try to compare my body to the letters of the sign as i’m falling past them to determine how big they are. i reckon standing straight with my arms stretched fully upright i might be half the height of the O in “MOM”, or any of the letters for that matter. the font is the same as it is inside on all the signs for the bathrooms, so when i’m going and i’m looking at the sign sometimes i like to imagine myself standing inside the little O. sometimes when i’m high and going in the bathroom i swear i can almost see myself laying down around in the curve of the O like i’m asleep, but that’s just a fun trick of the mind and not at all like when i’m awake and falling outside.
once i make it below the sign it starts to get easier to see on account of my eyes not stinging so bad from the light. all the floors are laid out just like they are on the map because it’s real, and i can see people going about their stuff through the windows. first i fall past the penthouse and Mom is always there in the same spot in bed, i always try to make eye contact but she’s always looking away or i’m going too fast to get a good fix on her eyes. i’ve nearly asked her a bunch of times if she’s seen me falling past her window before but i figured that when she does she’ll bring it up and i don’t want to bring it up first incase i seem crazy. i know she’ll seem really relieved when she sees me again after seeing me fall past the window, because it would come as a huge surprise and probably she’d be worrying that i was dead. or she’d be thinking that she was crazy! i know i’d be thinking one or the other if i saw someone falling past my window at night, that’s for sure. 
anyway once i’m done falling there i keep going and i can see rich people living in the nice rooms, and for the most part it looks like they’re having fun. normally i try to fall slower around these floors because they’re the most interesting. sometimes i can see them arguing or looking lonely, but mostly they’re eating or watching stuff on the intranet and sometimes they’re even having sex. it’s a rare sight but it’s premium because everyone on the rich floors is fat almost without exception, so seeing them have sex is a curio. there are only a couple hundred videos of people having sex on the intranet, and they’re all skinny people. that’s why seeing a glimpse of them like this is premium like i mentioned. i figure that making a sex video for the intranet is a way of making money outside if you’re caught short for cash, so it makes sense that rich people don’t do it. i’ve wondered before if the rich people feel left out when they’re watching those videos on the intranet because nobody looks even a little bit like them. floors 430-435 is the casino and these are also really interesting floors to fall past. you see a lot of people drinking and smoking and occasionally poking pens. normally when i poke pens they’re loaded with something to wind me down like Mdaz, or when i want to fall outside i do half Psilo half K which they call a “PK pen”. in the casino though i figure they’re all probably loading Crank orelse something that keeps them gambling and sharp all night. poking an Mdaz pen up there would set you far too optimistic on each hand of cards and you’d end up betting all your chips on a single pair or even on nothing at all. for as much as you can tell by falling past them, it appears like the people in the casino blink hardly ever at all if you catch my meaning. they always seem to be handing over their big pile of tokens but never looking too sad about it, they just laugh and someone comes to restock their tokens again in no time at all. 

just below 430 there are some maid floors which is where my fascination starts to wane sometimes, but they’re still interesting. mostly it’s just old servants and old bots washing dishes or folding linen. rich people don’t much trust young maids or newer bots because they get “ill notions”. they only ever entertain the company of youth if the purpose of that company is that they want something young, if you catch my meaning. every fifteen levels or so there’s a little block of maid floors and they tend to get younger and younger as you go down. some drunk bastard told me once that in the bottom hundred there’s near on babies cleaning down there, but i’m pretty sure he was just blowing hot air. from what i understand it there isn’t much of any cleaning going on down there at all, babies or otherwise. sometimes when you’re falling past these nice maid floors you’ll see a chef in there preparing up something really premium like a goat. the goats are raised somewhere way lower down and they take a long time to mature, that’s why i say they’re rare and you’d only see them being prepared above 400 for a rich person who is accustomed to something really premium. as you get further down the animal meals get fewer and far between, below i’d say 300 they’re gone altogether and people are just eating vegetables if you’re lucky or pastes if you’re not. around my number there might still be one or two rooms prioritising animal meals, i’ve never had a taste for them myself and that’s fine by me. you meet people who act like eating their animal meal is bringing them some sort of rush and for me that is unbecoming. for me, the meals are just what they are. once you know a real rush from something like poking pens i don’t know how you could go on pretending like you’re getting a rush from an animal meal.
falling through the high 300s it’s pretty much all OK rooms and you start to get near my floor. the people you see through the windows down here are mostly on the intranet orelse they’re high or out working. Mom has kept going at me for ages about moving up to the 400s so as i can be closer in eyeshot but i can’t stand the thought. damn near every rich person you meet is onto you about some hot new currency they’re peddling, either for you or just as a means of making “a connection” to someone else you might know. needless to say you can double and triple that five times over for me because of who i am and because they know i can get in with Mom, basically whenever i want to more or less. i swear to god, i would sooner move down 200. at least down there when people beg you they’re forthright about it and you know it’s because they’re hungry or want to get high or whatever else. i would take that any day over some fat man offering me “exciting opportunities”, that’s for sure. and what’s more, down there often people might not even recognise me. there’s a bar i like on 240 which doesn’t even have a name because it’s more or less just a room where people get drunk. i could sit in there having a drink all day and nobody would bother me in the slightest. you better believe i would sooner move there in a heartbeat than go anywhere near the nice rooms. sad news is when i’m falling i don’t get to get my eyes on any of the lower floors. my stop always comes at the same place where i started. there’s some places like the factories and the farms down in the 200s that must be something else to fall past, i’ve been there just wandering around of course but it must be something else to see them falling. not even to mention the places i’ve never stepped foot in down in the 100s where things start to get real rough and you wouldn’t want to get caught nosing around. people tell stories about getting down below the lower clouds and seeing the honest to god earth, but you always have to give them the side eye upon hearing stories like that. more often than not it’s some grown up boy blowing hard who’s never actually stepped foot in the 100s let alone the double digit floors. you’ll hear much more theorizing than first hand accounts anyway, that’s for sure. the last security office is on 99 and anything that goes on below that is between god and who ever else is involved. anyways i always get melancholy and start to fall as slow as i can once i start getting near my floor. my room is on 338 and i always know i’m getting close because of a certain pattern of windows that i can’t easily describe and my hand always starts getting itchy. as soon as i can see my window i can see myself laying there. i never get as much time as i want to ponder how i look. it’s not an opportunity you get often to really see yourself as if you were just some other person. when you look eye to eye in the mirror it feels very much like you’re looking at yourself, but when i’m awake and falling i can really see myself like a stranger. fully candid. i would just pause myself in the air there if i could and look for probably an hour without getting bored, no kidding. i can only ever linger like that for a second or two though, and then i can feel my eyes opening up even though they were already open. i look out the window straight away to try and catch a glimpse of myself falling but i’m always just a second too late. 

2. feeling time

once i got my bearings again i realised my blankets had gotten all wrapped around my line like they have a habit of doing and it was wicked itchy. most people these days have a small IV line in on the back of the hand to make it easier for poking a pen, or it’s supposed to make it easier anyway. i find they’re more trouble than they’re worth sometimes because they’re always getting itchy or flirting with infection. my skin was bone cold too, probably because my room was pretty cold like i normally keep it but actually probably because of how long i was falling out there. i took a real slow breath out to try savor the feeling of the outside air in my lungs but it was already all dead and recirculated. upon taking further stock of my state i was all kinds of shivering and pretty sickened too, in need of some kindnesses for sure. my bedside clock blinked 12:00 like it always does and i used the periodic flashes of red light to fumble around for antinausea capsules on the side table. most people prefer yellow Ondan tablets because they’re less likely to give you diarrhea than the purple ones, but they work a little bit worse. i normally take the purple ones because i like how effective they are and i’m generally not opposed to a little diarrhea, i think it gets a unfair rap unless you have something you really need to do that day. my room came into focus as my eyes adjusted back to the inside light and i’d be lying if i said it was in a perfect state. i told the maids to stop coming in a long time ago because they kept throwing away stuff that i figured still had some good use in. i like to smoke all my cigarettes twice, i smoke them all once to the place where you’d usually stop, set them down, then come back again a day or two later and then go again until it gets dicey on account of burning your fingers. i figure that this way i have basically twice as many, or some percentage more anyway. 
i tried to explain this to the maids and even showed a demonstration of which ones are ready for second smoking, but they couldn’t get the measure of it. in the end it was easier to just leave them be and tidy up on my own, because i didn’t want to be giving the same demonstration of second smoking over and over. i feel for the maids and i know they work a lot to make the same amount of money i make by doing nothing, so it didn’t feel right to be lecturing them or getting cross when they misjudged the measure of which cigarettes were still good for second smoking. crucial above all else in that moment though was loading a pen with Mdaz to find either sleep, orelse just some respite from the shivers that were plaguing me. some portion of it was surely just my chilled skin, but i also had a lingering anxiety about me. sometimes after a PK pen the Psilo part overstays its welcome and has a nasty paranoiac edge to it. without the K to balance things out you’ll find yourself double checking shadows in the room to make sure they’re still as they should be, or fixating on certain noises that may or may not be happening. it was raining outside so i found myself getting concerned and even downright upset at the way the drops were rolling down the window. some of them were converging too effectively, such that they became significantly larger than the other ones and it felt alienating to the smaller drops. 
these kinds of nervous personifications are good evidence that something has gone out of balance in your dose. when you’ve got your dose dialed in just right you won’t find yourself lost in sad empathy for the raindrops, they’ll all be doing just fine how they are or even be a source of relaxation. 
anyway all that to say i was getting increasingly restless to find a full Mdaz pottle and it seemed determined on not being found. Mdaz more than any drug i know has a nasty tendency to not be possessed in the quantities that you remember. god damn near as soon as you’ve poked the pen you forget that you’ve done it, and your mental inventory is immediately suspect. the pottles play into this little sham too because they’re fairly heavy on their own and the liquid is transparent. so as you’ll be thinking you have one or two left for sure in your mental inventory, and then upon picking them up the ruse is still alive until you see that the top has already been punctured by the pen. that’s one thing i do miss about having the maids around checking in on me, they’re always quick to remove the old pottles and it’s harder for you to get your hopes up on an empty one. needless to say i inspected them all anyway and concluded that a trip out would have to happen immediately. i was in a bit of a sorry state and usually i like to compose myself a little more when leaving the room, but i wanted to feel better quite urgently. 
all the clocks in the hotel run on centralised time, which means that when Mr Fab went quiet they all stopped working. i can vaguely remember what it was like back when they still worked, back when i was really young. i have little mini recollections of laying in bed and watching the numbers go up and up then back to the start again on my bedside clock. there are still a few big clocks in the hotel that work by some kind of mechanical system so they’re not on centralised time, there’s one in Mom’s penthouse and another one down on the farm floors that i know about. some people also have portable versions of these mechanical clocks but evidently they’re really tricky to make so owning one is extremely premium. i could have one i’m sure if i asked for it, but so few people keep time that it’s not a very useful measurement. and what’s more, most people you’d meet down here think of it as unbecoming to reference the time because it portrays a certain vanity or status. people already act wrong to me and treat me like i belong on the 400s as it is, so i definitely won’t be caught dead with a mechanical clock, that’s for sure. 
though i must admit, i would be lying if i said that “feeling” the time, as they call it, is a great system. unkept time is a wickedly subjective thing, you might have plans to meet up with so-and-so after so much felt time, and yet feel the time totally different to them. layer on top of that most people are poking pens or smoking tars or whatever else, which of course magnifies the personal nature of time feeling. people tend to be kind on this fact though, especially young people who have grown up without keeping time. for most of the year it’s dark outside for pretty much the whole day, on account of the hotel being very far away from the middle part of the earth and the earth being tilted. this means that mostly you feel time based on how long it feels since it was bright out, but it’s easy to miss! you could easily (and i do, often) doze off during the hour or two that it’s bright out and awake still thinking you’re in the same day. i’ve gone probably four days before still thinking it was the same one because i happened to doze off at coincidentally bad times. 
all this to say, the time then felt to me like it had been many hours since the sunlight. this meant that the preferable stores for buying Mdaz pottles were most likely closed, likely enough that it wasn’t worth the trouble to go check them and face disappointment. it’s important to keep a roster of backup plans for situations like this, and keep it mentally maintained so you know which plan is least likely to lead to heartbreak. about 10 floors down from me is a pen room run by a man named Nik, i don’t like him but is pretty much always having a party, or at least there. i figured i could get myself together enough to make it down and back and keep my cool. the raindrops on the window had begun to move faster and now i was getting concerned about the slow ones. i second smoked a few cigarettes and watched them anxiously as i built the nerve to stand up, some were moving alarmingly slowly but thankfully none were completely still. eventually i slid back into my underpants and put on a loose jumpsuit, it had a zip that started at my crotch and went all the way up to my chin. it also had a hood and one big kangaroo pocket for my pen, key, cigarettes and my money pouch. i stopped to take a look at myself in the mirror across the room before i zipped it up, my skin looked really pale and almost silver. the moonlight was strong from behind the clouds and i could see shadows of the raindrops running down my whole body. it looked like an endless parade of black ants were escaping out my head and running for their lives.  

3. echoing howl 

the hallway was piercingly bright. in truth it was probably just fine, but i keep the lights off in my room pretty much at all times. i only turn them on temporarily if i’m really certain that a sneaky pottle has evaded me and is hiding somewhere in the darkness. there’s no hiding out in the hallway though, that’s for sure. just long stretches of cream plaster walls and humming incandescent lights hanging from the ceiling above every set of doors. the amount of rooms per floor is different depending on how far up you are, but on my floor there are 108 rooms. my room is numbered 338.102, which is one of the better ones to have. you either want to be near the end of a floor or near the start because that’s where the stairwells are. elevators are dotted along the hallway so i guess it used to be better to live near them, but they all run on the centralised system so they don’t work anymore. the doors still open and close but none of the buttons do anything. it’s neat all the things people have found to use them for though, like around my level people will set up shops in the elevators for selling cigarettes or drinks, and further down people live in them like they’re tiny little rooms. it’s pitch black inside once you close the doors, so kids use them for kissing and teenagers use them for sex. up on the nice floors rich people don’t have much kind of imagination or trust for anything, so the maids use them for storage. if you ask me, it’s pretty neat all the things people find to do with a little room when you give them one. i quickly slipped into the stairway and started my journey down, and let me tell you the stairways are a mammoth thing indeed. there are some smaller ones for maid access hidden around the place, but they aren’t much worth talking about. the main stairways live on either end of the hotel like it’s a body with two spines, and they are almost unbelievably large to comprehend. wide enough that you could have a party of ten people walking beside each other arm-in-arm no problem, and what feels like infinitely tall. not really of course, but pretty much. if you put your neck out into the void over the railing, you can look up and look down and never come to see the top or the bottom. they must be miles high for real but i don’t know the exact measure of it. the steps are all dressed in old carpet for the most part but with hard stone edges, wicked hard if you stumble and catch your shin on the lip which i do on a damn near daily basis. i swear my shins haven’t gone unbruised a day in my life living up and down these stairs. the most godless thing about them is the sound. i suppose the architects must have done their best in thinking about this, but they didn’t do their best enough. when people are walking and talking one or two floors above or below you, you can pretty much hear them clear as day. then countless more people are walking and talking, about god knows what or how many floors away, and all their sounds start to bounce around inside each other and start procreating. you’ll be hearing hundreds or maybe thousands of little whispers and laughs and screams and cries, all overlapping. an echoing howl born all the way at the bottom, flung up the void, then ricocheting off the top and howling back down again. like you got every TV set in the world and somehow crammed them snuggly into your own head and turned them all on at once. 

i tell you it’s enough to make you think you’re going crazy if you come in here after the wrong pen, or otherwise just fragile for whatever reason. i wasn’t feeling in the best state for it, but i had felt a lot worse. luckily i had two things working for me, first of which based on some intangible quality of the echoing howl i could tell the hotel was sleepy. this confirmed my earlier theory that it was probably close to the next sunlight hour, which means a lot of people would be asleep or otherwise too tired for laughing and screaming. the second thing was i only had about 10 floors to descend before arriving at Nik’s corridor, so the journey would be mercifully short even at my impaired speed. ideally i would make it down the stairs without tripping or getting drawn into any kind of unwanted interactions. people don’t tend to go down the corridors unless they’re going to their room orelse have some kind of business there, so most of every social interaction you’ll have is on the stairs. i don’t have a huge amount of what you would call friends necessarily, although i am friendly with a lot of people and damn near every person knows who i am at least. basically every time i make eye contact with someone there will be a little flash of something come across their face, like a little moment of shock and surprise or sometimes excitement. i figure it’s not actually even about me really, more like they just see me and then immediately think of Mom and that gets them feeling some kind of way. the really wrong thing is sometimes i do it too, i’ll catch a reflection of myself and think of her instead of thinking about me. that kind of stuff doesn’t make much sense and isn’t worth dwelling on. 

i made it down to the landing at floor 327 which is Nik’s floor. there were a few people milling around the hallway entrance there like there normally is and i didn’t much feel like getting involved with them. an older man was slumped up against the wall with his eyes slightly flicking open and closed but he looked like he was having a good time. i could see a pen loosely gripped in his left hand and a half empty pottle of expensive Fent balancing on his thigh. the expensive stuff comes in a really premium plastic pottle with embossed pale green metal ridges on the sides, and i’m not lying when i say it feels really premium. when you run your thumbnail down the metal ridges they make tiny melodic tinking sounds that are not quite a song but damn near close. interacting with one of those pottles is pretty much a joy all own its own before you even get to the Fent, and certainly a joy afterwards. they’re something to be wary of though, especially if you’re more accustomed to the watery variety or a similar-but-cheap drug from the lower floors. one quarter of one of these “ribcage” pottles as they call them is probably stronger than a whole pen of the normal stuff. i don’t go in for the ribcages personally, or much of that kind of rush at all myself. not just because of the price (they are wicked expensive) but also because of the routine of it all. you see a person get in on the ribcages and all of the sudden it’s all they want to chat about and schedule around. it’ll take a stand up person and turn them sick, or just as soon it’ll take a sick person and turn them dead as the inside air.
standing right in front of the hallway door there were a couple of younger girls and a flashy looking bot, they were all prattling on in fast paced conversation. it’s considered rude to hang out right in front of the door, but i’m not the kind of person who makes a big deal out of stuff like that. the bot was going on about his arms and how strong they are. he made a joke about having completely smooth metal fingers and the girls laughed in a flirty way. i wanted to quickly glance at the fingers to see how smooth they were, but i had to turn sideways and make myself skinny to fit past the girls without bumping into them. there was a split second where my face was really close to the girl’s face and we were accidentally looking straight into each other's eyes at point blank range. this was exactly the kind of intimate interaction i wanted to avoid, and is exactly why it’s rude to stand right in front of the hallway door. i could see her eyes make almost instantaneous transitions from nothing, to confused, to shock, and finally shy or maybe excited, and then i was through the door and it slammed shut behind me. 
if i was in a different way like not still feeling edgy from the Psilo, i might have stopped and talked a while to them. in truth though, it’s a silly thought. when i imagine it i picture myself in their situation having the conversation like they were having it. i imagine myself like the girls, laughing flirty at the bot and him showing off for me. or maybe i’m the bot and i’m showing off for the girls, bragging about my smooth parts and who knows what else. in reality, i would be me and they would be them and i’d immediately be in the spotlight. the bot wouldn’t be talking about his fingers and the girls wouldn’t be flirty laughing. they’d all just be talking about Mom, most likely, or wanting to talk about her at least. we might pretend like we’re happily talking to each other about this and that, but really we’d all just be standing there. awkwardly not talking about her.

4. i know you

Nik lived a fair way down the hall and it felt like an accomplishment just to make it out of the stairway, so i took a moment to reward myself. i pressed my back into the wall and gently slid down until my ass hit the floor, the carpet was very thin and i could feel the cold concrete underneath transferring a chill up into my thighs. after fishing around in my kangaroo pocket for a moment i found my cigarettes and realised i had forgotten a lighter. this isn’t that big of a deal because damn near everyone carries a lighter, everyone except airheads like me apparently. mind you i wasn’t stoked about the sensation of asking someone for one, if god is merciful it can just be a quick transaction without too many pleasantries. i sat slumped against the wall for a while, probably 45 of the longest seconds of my life until a girl came out of the staircase door. she was young like me, young and pretty but she looked tired. she had short brown hair and seemed kind of familiar. she didn’t seem like she was going to look down at me on her own so i announced myself quietly, “uh, hello.” she glanced down but kept moving at first, “hey- oh, hi!” she said. during that tiny response i saw the usual three act play of recognition quickly flash over her face. thankfully she settled on a warm expression that was comforting, and didn’t trigger my Psilo cursed brain to sound any alarm bells. 

“what are you doing here?” she said. i could tell she was still kind of shocked to see me, i didn’t know whether it would be rude to stay slumped against the wall or if i should stand up. “i’m here to visit with someone but i was wondering if you have a lighter, ” my words were more run together than i had hoped they would be. not totally slurring or anything, but i definitely would have preferred about twice as much space between all of them. “yeah, yeah of course,” she said, feeling around in a deep pocket on the side of her skirt. she pulled out a cheap lime green flick lighter and handed it down to me. i plucked it out of her hand carefully so as to not accidentally touch her fingers and mumbled, “thanks, i’m always forgetting mine one place or another. i just need to keep it in the damn cigarette box, or keep an extra one so i have one to lose.” she smiled. she didn’t seem to notice that my words were coming out a little lumpy, or if she did notice she didn’t seem worried about it. i had a tiny amount of trouble getting my cigarette going (nothing major) and then handed the lighter back to her. she asked if she could join me for one and i said yes. in truth, i would have probably preferred the cigarette alone. i’m not the kind of person that would ever say something like that to someone though, i hold a bit of a double standard when it comes to that kind of stuff. i wouldn’t begrudge someone saying something like that to me, or i might even find it endearing, but me being so upfront like that to someone was totally out of the question. “it’s Antina by the way,“ the girl said, sliding down the wall next to me and lighting her cigarette. “thanks, i mean. cool, it’s a premium name,” i felt like i was fumbling the interaction even more now that she was on my level, and the cigarette was making my throat wicked dry. “thanks,” she said, “it’s OK. people call me Anti, which i think makes me sound like i’m an ant. or they’ll pronounce it like antenna, which really pisses me off too.” i nodded, i never know whether to introduce myself to new people by telling them my name, because more often than not i say my name and they say “i know”, and then a silence follows that makes everyone want to die. i think it’s kind of rude for me not to say it though. “i’m Sen,” i blurted it out quickly, taking another sip of my cigarette and kind of looking away. “yeah i know,” she said. i must have made some kind of face when she said that because she quickly followed up, “i mean, i know you. we’ve met before, a couple of times. at Nik’s place. is that why you’re on this level?” “oh shit,” i said, “shit sorry yeah, i thought you looked familiar, sorry there are always so many people there, and the lighting...” i lost my train of thought, “yeah i came down to see if Nik is in, i thought i had one more Mdaz but you know how they are, you always think you have one or two more than you actually do.” she laughed, “yeah i do that too. i always forget to throw away the packet,” i coughed and tried to make it sound like an agreement sound, “yes-,” i coughed again. my throat felt like it had never once come into contact with any form of liquid. 
“hang on, can you hold my cigarette?” she started rummaging around in her skirt pocket and her eyes went unfocused, like they were just staring straight through the wall. i could tell she was using her mind's eye to mentally assess the shape of many different items. the pocket was confusingly deep, it could accommodate her arm all the way up the elbow as she hunted around in there. she pulled out an empty pottle of Mdaz and her expression twisted in frustration. after a couple more failed attempts she finally produced a full pottle, “i think i actually only had one empty packet in there, i was just putting it back and finding it again,” she laughed, “i spend most of my life laying traps for myself to fall into later.” she set the pottle down on the ground between us and took back her cigarette. “i can’t take that pottle if it’s your last one,” i said. “oh yeah, i definitely don’t want to give it to you,” she laughed again, a warm kind of laugh, i could tell i was welcome to laugh too if i wanted. “we can share it though, i’m really tired anyway so i’d probably fall asleep right here on the floor if i had the whole thing myself.” i said thank you a bunch as we began about getting our pens ready, and i was already feeling a little bit better than before. Antina had a kind way about her, so i wasn’t overthinking everything quite as much as i usually do in this type of situation. “do you want to just do it here, or would you like to go somewhere else?” she said, “do you know the 322 gardens?” i shook my head no, i didn’t know them, “my body is wicked angry with me right now, i don’t think i want to brave the stairs again yet,” she agreed and didn’t want the stairs right now either. Mdaz pottles have little white lines on the side dividing them into quarters, so it’s easy to share them or have them in measured doses yourself. only problem being that once you have punctured the foil top, you can’t reseal them again. this means that if you do try have them in portions, you’re more likely than not to just bump them over and lose the remainder. i have had this happen to me probably 100 times, and then undergone the undignified act of trying to fill the pen from a puddle of essentially invisible liquid on the ground. it is kind of impossible if you spill it onto carpet, but i have still tried of course. one time i basically got the lot of it up, but i could see a bunch of carpet fibers and little mysterious dots floating around inside the pen. i sat there for probably a whole night just staring at it, trying to decide whether injecting carpet fibers would kill you. ultimately i decided they might, because i imagined them latching themselves onto the little textures in your heart or something like velcro, so i threw it away. Antina went first and then passed the half pottle over to me. her pen was dark purple with a cute sticker of a bat on it. i could see her muscles all melt into the wall and she breathed out slowly, a long even breath. “thanks,” i said again and filled my pen with the rest of the clear liquid. i pushed the tip right down into the corners of the pottle to make sure i got it all. i’ve thought before that there must be a better shape to make them, so as you don’t have to be so deliberate about getting all the corners. in fact, i would say all the rigmarole of using a pen makes it basically the worst way of consuming drugs. you have to be worrying about getting all the liquid or worrying if you’re having too much, not to mention the hassle of having a line. always catching it on your sleeves as you put on clothes, always getting itchy. 
if pens weren’t such a fantastically effective way of delivering the rush, they would be bottom of the barrel when it comes to enjoyableness. personally i much prefer the simplicity of swallowing a pill, not to mention the portability due to their compact size which is excellent. however, they take ages to come into effect and require patience. you can speed things up by having them as a powder up the nose, but that requires much more preparation and additional equipment so it bumps them down a grade. smoking is undeniably the most visually appealing method, but only when cigarettes are involved. it’s funny how quickly you go from looking sexy while smoking a cigarette to absolutely feral smoking a pipe. i think it’s about the shape of your hand holding the lighter and the unnatural position of your arm. elbow cocked at a sharp angle and flat, parallel to the body, objectively unappealing. the most boring-yet-functional method has to be transdermal patches. nobody knows when you have one on, and you yourself forget immediately too. going about the entire day and not even noticing that you have been ambiently useless since morning. i would rank them low, due to their passive nature and again, the tendency to get itchy. all that being said, i poked the pen into my line and immediately felt Mdaz rocket through my blood. it crashed against all the little textures inside my heart, flew up my spine and enveloped my brain in a warm slosh. all my petty criticisms vanished, and my entire soul was as light as a plastic tube. 

5. roses

we both just lay there for a good while before saying anything. i had slid even further down onto the ground, the hard concrete below the carpet was still emanating it’s chill and i emanated warmth back affectionately. Antina lit another cigarette and rolled her head to look at me. “do you know how old you are?” i said no, only roughly, “do you?”  “no, i thought you might. like somebody would be keeping track for you or something.” i fished another cigarette out of my kangaroo pocket and turned to to face her. she passed me the lighter. “i don’t know,” i said, “if someone is, they haven’t told me about it.” people can make mechanical clocks like i mentioned, but there is no such thing as a mechanical calendar that i know about. to combat this, some of the older people have been doing their best to count each day as it comes down on paper. i’ve only heard references to this practice, but as far as i can tell it’s basically nonsense. people seem to have just as much trouble feeling the years as they do feeling the hours, and i wouldn’t trust any old person on their word claiming to give you an exact date. i’ve heard five years, twenty, and everything in between. Antina took a long sip of her cigarette, “i think we look the same age,” she said. smoke bounced out of her mouth with each syllable, slowly curling up towards the incandescent bulb on the ceiling. “do you remember when Mr Fab was still working?” the bulb hummed and illuminated her smoke, i thought about the pink foam. “yeah, just barely. i remember my bedside clock working, and i remember talking to Mr Fab on the TV set,” i said. “i remember his voice sounding funny. i remember a maid telling me he sounded like that because he had an english accent. she said she lived in england before coming here and her old boss sounded just like Mr Fab.” i coughed and took another sip of my cigarette. “were you born here?” “yeah of course,” she said, “i can remember his voice too. i always thought that must be what god sounded like. i mean, i know that’s ironic now,” her eyes were fixed on some invisible point in the ceiling. “it must be comforting being a bot and knowing that there is a god, or was, or whatever. i don’t believe in god obviously, but if i could remember talking to him i probably would.” she laughed dismissively like she knew she was just high, rambling. “i think it sounds horrible,” i said, “knowing him, then he leaves and you don’t know why. especially for the older bots, the centralised ones. i think they.. were him? or some part of them was him anyway. i can’t even imagine what that would feel like, if a part of you suddenly vanished and every moment of your life you were just waiting for it to come back.” we talked about this for a quite a while. i said it sounds like phantom limb syndrome, she said it sounds like god went out for a pack of cigarettes and never came back. “i just don’t think i could live like that, waiting all the time,” she lit another cigarette off the glowing butt of her last one, “and you see that with the younger ones. my floor is low down, so most of my friends are bots. the only time they bring up Mr Fab is when they’re talking shit about centralised bots that worship him,” she had rolled onto her stomach and was laying straight across the floor like a torpedo, “they’re all too busy working or getting high or trying to fuck, just like the rest of us, they don’t have time for god.” we lay there in silence for a while and i thought about what it would be like to be a bot. i thought about Antina and her friends and what they do together. i pictured her hanging out with them and imagined some of their conversations. i tried to imagine her telling them about me, and wondered if they would be interested or not care. bots tend to not care about Mom as much as people do, so they’re more likely to not care about me. “how far down is your room?” i asked. “282.” that was low, for a person anyway. “what do you do down there?” i tried my best to sound casual, and not like i was being any kind of way about where she lived. “i work at the farms on 260. not food farming. i grow flowers for the 400s,” she took a sip of her cigarette and looked over at me, “i’ve never been up that far, so i don’t really know what they do with them. i picture like, some rich fat guy giving his girl one of my roses, or sprinkling the petals on the bed or something romantic. they always seem to need more and more roses, so maybe they’re eating them, i don’t know.” i rolled over, “they’re for the casino,” i said, “on 433 or 434, i can’t remember, there’s a restaurant in the casino called By Any Other Name. the entire bar is covered in roses, hundreds. it smells crazy in there, it’s kind of overwhelming.” she had a confusing expression on her face, like excited grief. “oh.” she thought about it for a while, “well, that’s fucking typical, isn’t it? rich people never fail to take something that is magical in moderation, then demand so much of it that it becomes sickening.” she angrily flicked her cigarette butt against the wall and it exploded in a tiny little shower of sparks. “so basically one third of my entire existence is dedicated to making some bullshit marketing gimmick possible, and people don’t even like it.” she laughed and kicked her feet against the wall and then kicked me. “should we go to that asshole’s room and buy this stuff already? i’m getting cold laying on the floor.” i said yes and we both inched our way back up to a standing position. my thirst was truly getting out of hand. “you don’t have any water in that bottomless pocket do you? i feel like i am in the early to middle stages of death,” she rummaged around with an exaggerated panic look on her face, just as a joke, “no, i feel like that too though. we’ll have to hold out until Nik’s place, or if things get really urgent we might need to drink each other’s piss.” we slowly shambled forwards down the hallway. i said that in a survival type situation, people normally drink their own piss. she scoffed, “Sen, that’s disgusting.”

6. birds on a wire

the hotel is a surprisingly nondescript building from the outside. surprising because, when it opened, it was sold to the world as the most premium place that there is on earth. 
‘The Future Is Like This’. that’s the subtitle. everybody here knows the story of the hotel, because the story is everywhere. pretty much damn near every wall you look at has a picture of the hotel, a picture of Mom (or both), and plaques. plaques on every surface ramble on about every possible detail: how it was designed, how it was built, how it’s run, Mr Fab, the bots, the intranet, the currency, the maids, the farms, the ‘Bottled Ecosystem’. no matter where you are, you are within eyeshot is a wall of text explaining to you how lucky you are to be there, and you feel lucky. i haven’t ever met one single person, outsider or local, that wants to leave. even now, when damn near most of the place doesn’t work anymore, everyone you ask would say that this is the closest thing earth has to paradise. once i met a wobbly old man in a 200s bar who moved in the day they opened the doors. he said to me, “the shine has come off the apple a little over the years, but that doesn’t matter one bit when the juice tastes this sweeeet.” this old bastard was splayed out on the floor, ambiguously bleeding from some hidden wound, begging for tokens. my life has never been in a rough shape like that, but even if it was i know i would feel the same way. people speculate that the outside doors don’t even open anymore, as they were most likely on the centralised system, but nobody has cared to check that i know of. people might wish their lives to be better, but by better they just mean maybe a little further up. maybe a few more tokens, or a little less work. a few more pottles than they have right now, and a new sweetheart to share them with. something in the old, dead air just tastes like home on your tongue. there are thousands of videos on the intranet of places all over the world, we’re not dumb about what’s going on out there. it looks like a beautiful place. i figure i’d probably live in a big city like New York or Dubai if i wasn’t born here, because they’ve got some pretty tall buildings. i only trust a building so long as it’s above the clouds. i reach my arms up and they stretch so far, tall like the tall buildings in New York. my sleeves are like the clouds. a little drip falls from the mouth of my line into my open windows. it’s so sour and peppery. hot but not temperate with little lumps. my vision comes into focus, my arms and then the ceiling, it’s red and dark and loud. the lights are spinning. 
“you back with us kid?” my eyes started bouncing around the walls and fixing on the faces around me, they were empty and sneering. “what?” i said, my voice was tiny. everyone laughed. “the Baby can’t handle his pen.” i sat up and all the blood rushed to my head. i was in Nik’s place. a small circle of people were humming around me, loud whispering to each other over the music. colored light strips ran across the ceiling behind a thick layer of smoke, they bathed everyone in an ominous red haze. their teeth were glowing yellow. i tried to say something but my lips barely moved. everyone laughed. “come again kid?” i worried i might vomit and not be able to open my mouth, where would it go then. “what’d i have?” i asked the audience. they laughed again, more subdued, like i told the same joke twice in a row. “wishbone. looks like yours came true.” someone passed me an empty pottle. it was a Fent ribcage, but it was stained a milky color and i could see little white flecks all over the plastic on the inside. a mod drug. my heart was pounding and my skin felt numb, there was clearly some kind of amphetamine VS opiate race war waging in my bloodstream. my eyes bounced around the room in really fast slow motion. “where’s Antina?” i said, but nobody heard me. the audience had lost interest. a girl was laying near me, trying to fill her pen from another modded pottle and everyone had started focusing on her. she was having trouble getting through the foil top, it looked like her hands weren’t working properly. shaking and then balling up, she was digging her nails into her palms but smiling. her breasts were exposed and someone was trying to paw at them from slightly too far away. she was twisting her torso either towards them to make it easier, or possibly away to make it harder, i couldn’t tell. that was a good encapsulation of the tone in general; i couldn’t tell whether this was a really fun party, or if i had just woken up dead in hell. it certainly looked like hell, visually speaking anyway. glowing red, thick with smoke, little flames erupting at random from around the room, an ambient sense of danger, countless demons.. but all the demons looked like they were having so much fun. they were all laughing and cuddling, i couldn’t see anyone having sex but it definitely felt like they were, somewhere very nearby. maybe i was having fun too? it felt impossible to tell. a red hand swooped in from stage left and lit the cigarette that was evidently already in my mouth. “thank you!” i shouted, “this cigarette is awesome!” waves of joyful terror swept through my body. the girl had managed to get a pottle open and poked the pen into her line. demons were on either side of her, pinching at her nipples. “hey she got it open- you got it open!” i yelled at her. my teeth were chattering because i was enjoying my cigarette so much. i was nibbling on the filter like a little piece of spongy bubblegum. a demonic bot was tapping me on the shoulder from behind, “hey! are you the Baby?” i turned around and looked at him. his eyes were glowing. “yeah!”, i shouted back, “but i hate it when people call me that, my name is Sen!” he put his hands around my shoulders. the metal felt cool and soothing, i realised my skin was boiling hot. “oh god, can you touch my face? my skin is SO hot, i’m burning up!” he placed both of his palms against my cheeks, it felt like my skin must be melting and dribbling down his wrists like icecream. “my skin feels like it’s dribbling down your wrists, like icecream!” i yelled, an inch away from his face. “i don’t know what you mean!” he started kissing me. my tongue dryly thudded around inside his mouth, like i was looking for a lightswitch in a foreign metal room. “holy shit, i am so thirsty!” i said, “sorry i need to find something to drink right now,” we stopped kissing. he laughed and disappeared backwards into the red darkness. i stood up and my legs were substantially different lengths. there was a bottle on the table next to me that had one mouthful of beer left and a cigarette butt floating inside, i pressed my teeth together as i was drinking it to filter out the butt and the ash, allowing liquid to pass through. ‘everyone will know i am so bohemian’, i thought smugly to myself. the amphetamines had started winning the race war and my brain was a molten hot piece of glass, crystal clear and expanding in every direction. i scanned the desert horizon for another oasis. “god damn it demons, i need WATER!” i screamed at a pack of dogs making sand angels in the carpet. the music was wicked hypnotic and my body parts all took up instruments in the band. “where is the bathroom!” i shouted at something. my legs were on the bass drum and shot me forwards in low thumping rhythm. “are you keeping it from me, demon?” my snares, formerly hands, snapped on the shoulder of each passer by. fingers rolling across their skin in intricate high hat patterns. “oh my god, it’s you!” a huge demon stopped me and came in for an embrace. he was honestly enormous, for a moment i disappeared into his body like i was returning to the womb. “can you help me find the bathroom?” i cooed into his bosom. “of course my little celebrity, do you want to climb on?” “AAAH!” i screamed and scrambled up his mountainous back. with our newfound height i could really get the lay of the land. evidently i had only made it a few feet from where i started, but it was a truly historic journey. i could see the girl with the nipples and her demons, rolling around on the desert floor far below me. my old beer bottle was there next to them, a speck in the distance. i squeezed my faithful steed tight, “ONWARDS!” and we were off in a canter. our bodies aligned seamlessly, i clasped my forearms in my hands and wrapped my legs around his waist. 
my feet lay flat against each other’s soles and my toes perched atop the bulge of his penis, like birds on a wire. we crashed through the bathroom door and i flung myself off him onto the cold tile floor.
